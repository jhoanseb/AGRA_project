---------->I would still avoid Israel, especially being an American. Maybe Israel is accepting of LGBTQ and women, that's great! Thing is, virtually every country that surrounds them -- doesn't. At ALL.  The Palestine conflict is way out of hand to the point of shooting live rounds at people across the fence.  Trumpinator has seen fit to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and built a new emb***y there.  The amount of ***t stirring that equates to is just shy of the Mohammed drawings in Europe that lead to several deaths by driveby.  For clarification, I am avoiding ALL of the Middle East. Including Egypt. The Pyramids are a sight to behold, I'm sure, but there is way too much troubling bull***t going on and simply isn't worth the risk.  After 2 years a Christian pastor from North Carolina was finally released from Turkey after the failed coup which they claim he had some collaboration.

They screw around with other men and then ask Allah for forgiveness on Friday.  They don't have a problem (privately) with men having *** with each other, it's the fact that if you identify with being Gay you have the ability to fall in love with another man, that's abhorrent to them![TallulahVonDerSloot|2|0|e8ejlwt|2018-10-25 05:41:16]

-------->> I think that's pretty reasonable.   Not really. It's explainable or understandable, not necessarily reasonable.  Like, I understand that human empathy is tribal.   But, at a certain point,we're responsible for how we act. Especially in cases where we share some responsibility (many nations sell weapons and provide succor to Saudi Arabia)   It's hard to argue that the deaths of hundreds or thousands of Yemenis, the suppression of the rights of many women activists in Saudi Arabia fighting for the things MBS is being praised for bringing about should count less than the sad story of one journalist, who you don't even have any true connection to either (he's not at your Sunday church meet is he?)  If you try to justify this morally (as opposed to just explaining it) you're probably going to end up saying some pretty unfortunate things about the value of those other lives. [Tsegen|79|0|e8e9qz3|2018-10-25 03:07:22]
---------->Look at it this way: I saw a story about how Saudi Arabia bombed a bus full of kids however long ago that was and I remember being angry. I've also gotten angry or felt bad about some bit of news thousands of times since then, so I don't think it's actually unreasonable for us to forget about things that "don't affect us." Realistically, a bus full of kids in another country is much less important to most people than a well-known man who lived in their country and had a reputation etc. I haven't really liked MBS since I first read about him when he started gaining power, but he hasn't really been in the spotlight much recently so I honestly forgot about him and haven't given it much thought unless Saudi Arabia is mentioned. Now for the last three weeks, Saudi Arabia has been the main point of attention, so that gives everyone an opportunity to talk about it again. A lot of people also didn't even hear about the bus full of kids or anything else he did, so this might be their first exposure to MBS doing something egregiously ***tty because it's by far the most publicized one.[Hugo154|31|0|e8eeo6v|2018-10-25 04:24:55]

-------->Here’s the problem with a cis man being cast as a trans woman: At the end of the day, a lot of people are still going to think that a trans woman is just a dude in a dress. It would be more acceptable to cast a cis woman as a trans woman than a cis man as a trans woman because the bottom line is that trans women are still women, not men in dresses. I mean, ideally Hollywood would throw trans actors a bone and at the very least cast trans actors in trans roles because they certainly are getting any other roles at the moment.

---------->Oh wow, you kind of blew my mind here. So, trans folks have the issue of people judging them as a fake version of their gender (as ***ed up as that is), and these casting choices reinforce the problem. I never considered this and am now realizing I still have much to learn , thank you for the information![Tidusx145|50|0|e8ecshc|2018-10-25 03:55:31]
------------>>It would be more acceptable to cast a cis woman as a trans woman than a cis man as a trans woman because the bottom line is that trans women are still women, not men in dresses.  such a simple idea, but something i would never have thought of as well[seethar|34|0|e8edd24|2018-10-25 04:04:16]
------------>I initially thought a more famous person would spread the message more and expose it to a wider audience, but then I started thinking more along the lines of a white actor in blackface as an accurate representation of black people and I can see their point. [throwawayMambo5|20|0|e8edgpp|2018-10-25 04:05:54]
-------------->That one makes sense. I had a similar thought. How often are males cast as females or females cast as males? It does happen and usually in a comedic way, but not very often at all.  How well does a male understand what it is like to be a female? Sometimes my understanding of science, such as physics, takes me out of the story and breaks the illusion.  **Edit:** completed a thought better[amardas|7|0|e8eg6zk|2018-10-25 04:48:34]

------------>That doesn't sound to me like what they're saying at all.  It's cis people who are getting cast in trans roles, not trans actors in any state of transition, whether earliest or final.  There isn't any question surrounding Eddie Redmayne being cis that I know of, so he's not the same as a trans woman who's only just begun living that way.[desacralize|24|0|e8edtml|2018-10-25 04:11:33]

------------>Transgendered =/= post-op  I'm not sure how you arrived at the conclusion you did, because I don't see anything in that comment equating being transgendered to having had surgery.  What I interpret is that a cis-woman is a better representation of a transwoman than a cis-man is.  Both are, however, not good representations of transwomen.[PastaSupport|6|0|e8ee3d9|2018-10-25 04:15:42]

---------------->If having a male body is the criteria then yes.  I would hazard to guess that having a male body is not the point, however.  The point seems to be that transwomen are women, and therefore better represented by women than cis-men.  I'm not transgendered so I'm obviously not a definitive source on what the trans community thinks, but the above post seems to have a very good handle on things.[PastaSupport|10|0|e8efh3s|2018-10-25 04:37:32]

---------->But that's exactly what Scarlett was doing, and that wasn't good enough either.  I think this whole Tumblr outrage is just going to cause artists to stay away from the subject altogether, because if they do end up finding a trans actor they'll *** about the director not being trans, or the writer, or the sound guy.  Meanwhile Trump is one step away from putting you guys in camps, and all you do is spend your energy ***ing off your allies.[Jonne|-3|0|e8eepsv|2018-10-25 04:25:38]
------------>Scarlett is a cis woman who was cast a trans man. Dante Gill self-identified as a man. So she was doing the same thing that Jared Leto won an Oscar for (a cisgendered actor playing the role of a trans character of the opposite gender).  I am inclined to agree that there is a lot of infighting on the left that is detrimental to the success of the liberal movement, but that doesn’t mean people are wrong to speak up when they are being marginalized. I personally do what I can to pick my battles but I recognize that no one has the right to dismiss someone else’s experiences. I myself have learned a lot about listening and ask myself why I feel anger when someone corrects me about an issue. If more people were open to small changes in their behavior rather than getting mad over being asked not to use “spirit animal” or use a certain ***oun we would be in a much different place, methinks.[ThatsWhatSheaSaid|18|0|e8eg11w|2018-10-25 04:46:02]
-------------->There's nothing wrong with voicing your opinion and saying you'd prefer the casting to be different, but it seems like they went all out on her even though it seems like her heart was in the right place at least (or she really wanted to do some Oscar bait).  Either way, it seems like the Tumblr crowd want everything to be perfect immediately, and that ***t just doesn't happen. Changing society's views on people takes generations, and perfect is the enemy of good in those situations.[Jonne|3|0|e8egl29|2018-10-25 04:54:32]
---------------->I think you might be misinterpreting the notion that the Tumblr crowd thinks everything should be fixed overnight. For one, demographically they are a young crowd, and young crowds tend to make more noise than older (re: Reddit) crowds. Tumblr definitely does not represent the entire liberal movement. Secondly, I think everything feels more intense because we are in the middle of a pendulum swing. I guess I have no way to source this but when Obama was in power it felt like the liberal movement was less combative and not quite as angry about social injustices, but now a president who is the an***hesis of everything we stand for is in power so of course we are all riled up. I would bet money that the next time we have a Democrat as president the left will simmer down again (until the next republican president). I guess what I’m saying is, I think you’re looking at a snapshot of the left right now and it’s unfair to look at that snapshot and say that’s how we’ve always been and always will be. These are interesting times we live in.[ThatsWhatSheaSaid|7|0|e8ehtdr|2018-10-25 05:13:35]

-------->Not trans but am gay with many trans friends. To add into what has already been said, the beginning of the movie really out me off when it appeared like he instantly became trans after touching a dress. It’s like touched a dress *boom* trans. Like others have said, it reinforces the idea that a trans woman is just a man in a dress and it also glosses over a lot of the internal struggle.

I've never seen it. but her feelings were along the lines that the plot was basically the dude's life was destroyed after he was disabled. And I think he wants to commit suicide.

I agree that the best actor should generally be chosen, but every role has constraints. I don't know if we know anything about the screening process or who else was considered. One trans actress' condemnation of the casting (wish I could remember who, it was a compelling piece) stated that she wouldn't be so upset if she saw trans performers getting straight roles, but it's always the majority that bites into minority roles and get to tell their stories, breaking through the other way is really rare. There's no equality.  Gary Oldman played an achondroplastic dwarf recently, but, a long time ago, white people very regularly played characters of different races, particularly Asian ones.[substandardgaussian|4|0|e8eilli|2018-10-25 05:25:37]

---->I’m sure there’s a trans actress that has just as much merit to play that part, the problem is that it’s not about merit, it’s about marketability. Scar Jo is a super star that puts ***es in seats in a way an actual trans actress no one has heard of just wouldn’t.     Now there’s a good point to be made that movies are an industry and they need to make money, and I don’t fault them for that, but this is how you wind up with movies like *The Last Samurai* starring Tom Cruise and other comical stuff like that.    It’s not something that has a simple answer. I think the best example of a solution we can find is from the African-American community, who went from largely ignored in the 60s and 70s to having super stars making gangbusters numbers in the 90s and 00s, but that’s not an easy process and there’s gonna be some growing pains. I think this Scar Jo Asian/transgender controversy is one of those growing pains and I don’t really fault either side for feeling the way they do.[Stalin_2020|1|0|e8eg4sy|2018-10-25 04:47:37]
------>Well she was going to playing a trans man, but I agree even though it sucks. I wish there were even any high profile trans actors in films. I know we’re a very small part of the population but there’s got to be some great trans actors out there. [amcvega|2|0|e8eo1x6|2018-10-25 06:56:19]
-------->>she was going to playing a trans man.    Damn it....... anyhoo yeah it does suck but there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. Even though trans actors and trans people in general are a small part of the population, the same could be argued for the gay population of the United States and look at Neil Patrick Harris. He’s the very definition of a super star not just because he’s really well known and easily marketable, but he’s got huge crossover appeal from stoner comedy movies to huge 100 million dollar action movies to serious award nominated films and that’s hard to ignore. I have little doubt that a trans person will reach that dizzying height, and even higher still given enough time.[Stalin_2020|1|0|e8eq8do|2018-10-25 07:39:27]

------------>You’re making a straw man argument. You can’t compare blackface, a genre created out of hate, to Scarlett Johansson being offered the opportunity to play a legitimate role telling a real story. Her star power could have helped tell this story to millions, instead its just going to be lost.   I hate to break it to you, but she’s an actress, I suppose she should back out of her role as Black Widow too because she isn’t a real super hero. [hihcadore|5|0|e8egszf|2018-10-25 04:57:54]

---->***, /r/movies is so thick on this. It isn’t just because she’s not trans, it’s because trans actors don’t have wide access to cis roles. People would *** if it was a biopic about a famous or influential person and was played by a transactor.  As a result, trans people only really play trans characters on TV which in itself is already a niche market and makes it hard for trans actors to work.   Having ScarJo in the role infringes on the tiny market they have, setting a precedent that trans people will not see major representation as artists in moderate budget films.  Everything else is pretty secondary. The story doesn’t even really need to be told considering that it’s about a trans gangster iirc and that could have pretty negative implications anyway depending on how it’s handled.

---->I don't think anyone was arguing ScarJo exiting the role harmed her career. It's more than likely going to be harmful for the movie. It's plain to see that an A-list actor is going to more easily get the funding and exposure necessary for a movie like this.[ARealSkeleton|2|0|e8ecpe7|2018-10-25 03:54:10]

-------->While I myself am not trans, I have many friends in the LGBTQ community and I deeply want a movie for them to succeed. And while yes, you still can with a few no name actors, it is a handicap. And ScarJo is a great actress who would've done a great part. Another actor I was impressed with was Jared Leto in Dallas Buyer's Club. While he is not trans (to my knowledge at least) he stilled did an amazing and emotional portrayal of a trans character.[ARealSkeleton|1|0|e8edee1|2018-10-25 04:04:53]
---------->Somehow I think the trans community will persevere if “Rub ‘n’ Tug” doesn’t get made because ScarJo pulled out.[jetpackswasyes|1|0|e8edgrj|2018-10-25 04:05:55]

I mean, trans actors have waited this long for roles, what’s a few more lifetimes, right?[jetpackswasyes|0|0|e8edrjp|2018-10-25 04:10:39]
---------------->That is not what I said. I said this cis actor currently up for that role offers a better opportunity for a movie about a minority issue. I didn't say we should always use straight actors over trans actors. Are you actually wanting a dialogue here because you sound like you just want to be contrarian.[ARealSkeleton|2|0|e8eegv1|2018-10-25 04:21:38]

-------------------->I think they should cast actors according to the need of the movie. Generalizing something never gives you a good result. And you don't always need a gay man to portray a gay man. That's the point of acting.[ARealSkeleton|1|0|e8eet0l|2018-10-25 04:27:04]
---->Who determines the need of the movie? Reddit?[jetpackswasyes|1|0|e8eexo6|2018-10-25 04:29:08]
------>Whether it's getting funding and the attention it'll need to attract audiences. Reddit has nothing to do with it. Also, why are you so combative?[ARealSkeleton|1|0|e8ef1pn|2018-10-25 04:30:52]
-------->I’m trying to understand your logic.  Should Brad Pitt have been cast in Mahershala Ali’s role in Moonlight if it would’ve gotten them a bigger budget and higher profile? He’s objectively a bigger star.[jetpackswasyes|1|0|e8ef6vv|2018-10-25 04:33:05]
---------->Mahershala Ali is a big enough actor. I'm not saying that big name actors are always needed. You keep fixating on that. I'm saying that it's not some kind of afront for an actor that isn't gay to represent a gay character. That was the entire point.[ARealSkeleton|1|0|e8efh1k|2018-10-25 04:37:30]
------------>What about a white actor playing a black character in any new studio film, would you be okay with that?[jetpackswasyes|1|0|e8efqks|2018-10-25 04:41:35]
-------------->As someone else pointed out to you earlier, there's a bit more history to that. Blackface was used intentionally to harm black people.  I feel like the conversation needs to end because you're only looking for ways to argue your point and not actually communicate about this. I hope you have a nice day.[ARealSkeleton|1|0|e8efzk5|2018-10-25 04:45:24]
---------------->Actually I’m using the Socratic method. I find it fascinating that you understand blackface is undesirable, but cannot understand why the trans community largely doesn’t want to see a non-trans actress in a trans role. Like, the logic just seems to short circuit and I can’t quite see how you square the circle, so I’m just asking questions to see the edges of your perspective and logic. I still don’t get it, because it seems obvious to me that the motivations behind the objections are exactly the same as those against black face.[jetpackswasyes|1|0|e8eg4lr|2018-10-25 04:47:32]
------------------>There's a very clear difference between the history of slavery and the history of discrimination against the LGBTQ. I don't see how you don't understand that. But with the logic you're using, we should never allow a straight actors to portray a gay character. Or a gay actor to portray a straight character. With that logic would you say then that it's wrong for Rami Malek to portray Freddie Mercury in the movie Bohemian Rhapsody?[ARealSkeleton|1|0|e8egfsa|2018-10-25 04:52:20]
-------------------->Why does black = slavery? Using your logic could Tom Hanks have played one of the pirates in Captain Phillips since they weren’t descended from slaves?  Do you think there are physical attributes that might come into play with trans characters that aren’t present with cis gendered gay characters? Rami Malek doesn’t require any makeup or prosthetics to “make” him gay. That may not be the case for a trans character. It’s certainly not the case for whites playing in blackface. Where’s the line for you?[jetpackswasyes|1|0|e8egvjg|2018-10-25 04:59:00]
---->The context of blackface is very important. And the suffering that actual physical slavery of Africans throughout history is nothing to be compared to. It's on its own level.  The physical aspects are not important. You're boiling it down to a simple question of anatomy and that's nowhere near comparable to changing the actual skintone of someone.  Constantly mentioning the word "logic" doesn't make you any smarter. It doesn't make your argument any better. And I'm giving up hope. Have a nice day. I'm no longer responding.[ARealSkeleton|1|0|e8ei8q0|2018-10-25 05:20:05]
------>So it seems like you’re saying trans people haven’t suffered enough historically to protect their right to be portrayed accurately in film and media, at least not compared to black people.  I’m glad you won’t respond again, I can’t understand your thought process at all, it seems completely irrational to me.[jetpackswasyes|1|0|e8eidvb|2018-10-25 05:22:16]

-------->> Eddie Redmayne  Um, he's not trans. And most of us have never heard of him.[StockDealer|0|0|e8ejgqk|2018-10-25 05:38:57]
---------->I know he's not trans,  I'm pointing out that casting a famous cisgendered actor doesn't do the trans community any favors. You personally may not have heard of him, but he's an oscar winner who's starring in the new Harry Potter series (along with dozens of other blockbuster credits). He's got more accolades than ScarJo, that's for ***ing sure[agent_raconteur|1|0|e8enaf3|2018-10-25 06:42:08]

---->Iden***y politics run amok.[HonkyOFay|-5|0|e8eb0u9|2018-10-25 03:27:40]
---->Because trans actors exist, and trans people would benefit more from a trans person to identify with/look up to, in basic terms. Trans stories for trans people can still be told, so this idea that this movie couldn't be told without Scar Jo is dumb in the first place, because that movie *shouldn't* be made unless you can get a trans actor for it. They are out there and they want work just like any actor, and some of them are incredibly talented and perfect for whatever role comes their way.  Edit: to be clear, I'm not talking about actors that I know of. It's an unfortunate reality that trans actors are deeply underrepresented in Hollywood and, well, everywhere. They're just recently being accepted by society as a valid thing, let alone put in major roles. But if you think that trans people don't/can't have the same level of talent as anybody else, then you should really take time to examine your own bigotry. We should get trans actors known, and let them have their own spotlight for their own stories. [time_lord_victorious|-23|0|e8ealbg|2018-10-25 03:20:55]

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Transgender\_and\_trans***ual\_actresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Transgender_and_trans***ual_actresses) (there's many more) Nobody is asking them to play cisgender characters so if they can't even play trans characters they'll never break out. It's a vicious cricle.[Erebeon|7|0|e8ecaee|2018-10-25 03:47:39]

------------>It doesn't work like that. Even now hollywood is still afraid to cast women or minorities as big budget leads. Believe me there are great trans artists out there. Check out Neon Demon for example. [Erebeon|3|0|e8efago|2018-10-25 04:34:39]
-------------->I can't even take Neon Demon seriously as 2 consecutive words.   Edit: looked it up. It's a movie. I thought some tranny actor was named "neon demon".  Okay what about the movie?[PaigeTheGreat|-2|0|e8ehiub|2018-10-25 05:09:12]

------------>Hollywood is the most "woke" place on earth, in that it is mostly white people, and mostly white men, pretending *very hard* to be accepting, yet constantly underrepresenting nearly every minority out there. If you honestly think that trans actors are inherently holding themselves back, or whatever you seem to be implying, you should probably acknowledge your own biases and try to understand why you hold them.

---->I think you’re confusing transves***e/cross dresser with transgender person. Cross dressing is dressing as another gender for fun/play/whatever. Transgender has to do with your gender iden***y. The character in Rocky horror is not transgender if my memory serves.  This issue comes down to representation. There are not a lot of roles in Hollywood for trans actors. Tbh I can only name one. So if a role comes up that is literally a trans character, why put a cis person in that role? If trans people aren’t even being casted to play trans characters, then there’s little chance of mainstream representation [merpsicle|2|0|e8eox98|2018-10-25 07:12:53]
---->Transves***es are not trans in any way at all. Transves***e literally means wears clothes of other gender. No dysphoria, no transitioning, not even gay. Also Tim Curry was an actual transves***e, unless those were really well camouflaged male clothes. It's like saying an actor played a doctor and the movie was good, but in the remake they had a real doctor play a doctor and he was a bad actor so it was bad.[Inquisitor1|4|0|e8eijuf|2018-10-25 05:24:52]
------>I’m not the most PC guy around, all I know is they threw in a ***t actor in the remake because he “represents” LGBTQ as an “actor” because he’s trans***ual.   Same goes for the the guy that played Eddie in the remake. He’s gay so they needed him for the movie. If they were smart they would have sucked off enough people to get jack black to play Eddie.

------>Here's the thing about Redbox. . .yes, some big name movies with excellent actors, etc, get onto it. They make up anywhere from 10-30% of the ***les I'll see on it. The rest of Redbox's catalogue? That's made up of the likes of the Ben Hur remake, the Independence Day sequel/remake, the Ghostbusters remake, and mediocre or outright bad productions that either flopped or just didn't quite make enough in the box office. The movies that cost 80-160 million to make, top out at barely twice that estimation in the box office, and get peddled off wherever they'll be accepted to make as much money as possible before being gracelessly relegated to the dustbin of cinematic history.[TimeZarg|0|0|e8ebly2|2018-10-25 03:36:53]
-------->Maybe Redbox is different where I live. If I go to a Redbox right now, the first few slides will be full of recent big movies like superhero stuff, the latest Disney/Pixar animated film, popular dramas and musicals, etc. It’ll take me a while to start finding direct to DVD stuff.

---->Does a film exist if there's no one to watch it it[Fortune_Cat|17|0|e8eauwc|2018-10-25 03:25:08]
------>a film supportive of trans issues with a a-lister to get people in seats  would be far better then a great film that ***ody watchs for issues like this[CommanderL3|15|0|e8ebmyq|2018-10-25 03:37:20]
-------->Imgine, if you would, changing the context from Trans to Black. The black population is signifigantly smaller than the white population, so you might be inclined to make movies that appeal to white people. But, then if you depicted a black person, played by a white person, directed by a white person, and written by a white person, then there really isn't a check for harmful biases about black people in there. If the black audience were given a choice between mediocre representation or absent representation because all the slots were filled by white people, they'd probably also decide upon the actual representation, and we know they did because blackface is considered rude and offensive.  In this we learn that the actual value of a product that depicts a life of a marginalized member of society is not worth it if it doesn't ever actually depict or raise the conditions of that marginalized group. It's more like reducing the lives of marginalized people down to spectacle for the enjoyment of the m***es.[Bunerd|-2|0|e8edmj4|2018-10-25 04:08:24]
---------->I would think that white actors playing black actors would be a lot more accepted if black people made up less than a tenth of a percent of the population.[pokebrah|3|0|e8ef6s7|2018-10-25 04:33:03]
------------>0.5% is still 1 out of every 200 people. Just cause it isn't a single percentile doesn't mean it's a small group. There's quite a bit more than a hundred people in the world.  Honestly, if you try, I know you can find trans people to staff your projects, we're eager to rebuild our image after years of just constant suppression and suspicion. You just gotta be willing to accept that you have to hire trans people to play trans people. Once you accept it, it becomes much easier to move on from there.[Bunerd|4|0|e8efio6|2018-10-25 04:38:13]
-------------->But there is no trans Scarlett Johansson. If you want a star of that caliber in your movie it's literally impossible simply because there is no trans actress that is as big as she is. I'm 100% for using an actual member from a group you are trying to represent but sometimes it just doesn't align with the goal of the film.[pokebrah|6|0|e8eii5z|2018-10-25 05:24:07]
---------------->Trans actors will get bigger as they are hired to fill bigger roles. If your goal of the film is to sell a transgender life; sell a transgender life.  Look, aside from Sense8, a show written and directed by two trans women and starring a third, I rarely see the positive sides of being transgender. I'm never shown a person who is normal, like myself, i always get a condensed form of the tropes and stereotypes of being transgender, and a lot of outdated views at that. I like to say it's the fifth most interesting thing about me. I manage a small business, I code my own programs I use for work, I do m***ive projects in my maker ***e, and I get really deep into philosophy, but when people know I'm trans, those stereotypes are all they think about it. All the diverse expression of my community boils down to "a man that wants to be a woman," or "a woman that wants to be a man." Which isn't how it works, and is a myth that has caused so many people on the internet to ***ume that trans rights are a bull***t delusion, and people can be sorted rather neatly into binary ***es. It's really complicated, but 99% of society doesn't see the complications and can easily ***ume the wrong thing.  Now I'm a woman who looks like a woman, is functionally indistinct from other women in social situations, and I have the government presenting new laws that force me to use a bathroom consistent with the mistakenly ***igned gender at birth instead of allowing me to blend in with the crowd unmolested by authoritarian forces. They know if they heavily restrict my access to public facilities they restrict my ability to operate in public ***es, which is a fundamental human right. But people raised on media and not conversations with trans people come to the conclusion that we don't need human rights. Because we're delusional freaks in their eyes.  How we portray trans people in media has real political ramifications for us, and that cannot be ignored. There's a reason I'm unwavering.   If it becomes more normal and expected to see trans people living authentically as ourselves, the narrative surrounding transgender people dissolves and we become just more people. People see us as the gender we are and have less of a problem capitulating to our needs.[Bunerd|1|0|e8ekbho|2018-10-25 05:52:26]
------------------>do you want people on your side  a film with a hollywood A-lister that supports you gets more people on your side  [CommanderL3|3|0|e8el7ch|2018-10-25 06:06:42]
-------------------->I want people on my side, but I disagree with your *a priori* ***ertion that a big hollywood star playing the role of someone who does not have the same gender as her is going to really get people on my side. It's way more likely to muddle my message and get in the way of my activism.  No. I've actually studied a lot about this- my life literally depends on it. I have ways of getting people on my side without submitting to outdated traditions and existing authorities, and I've discovered that they are not nearly as powerful as anyone thinks they are. The weight of my community acting against something that betrays our existence is powerful enough to stall out movie projects and waste money, eventually they'll give into my demands and realize that they really aren't unreasonable or lacking motivation when they look at it.[Bunerd|0|0|e8elq1u|2018-10-25 06:15:04]
---->or they will decide its not worth it   they dont want the big movie with the hollywood a lister  then *** em  they can have the film that ***ody sees   people seeing the film and understanding your struggles will do much more good then this pointless crusade your own   and all you will do is shoot yourself in the foot[CommanderL3|1|0|e8eme2w|2018-10-25 06:26:09]
------>Did you whine this same way when you found out that a girl was going to star in Star Wars?[Bunerd|0|0|e8en1yw|2018-10-25 06:37:48]

---------->The worst aspect of privilege is when someone makes themselves the victim of it. You're sitting here telling me that if I do not appeal to your specific interests, that is if I do not let my interests slide for yours, I deserve failure. It's just a sentiment I hear a lot to a lot of people, and honestly, they're catching on and getting as sick of it as I am. Instead of appealing to you, I'm just going to appeal to them.  I don't think you're a "horribly ***ist" person. Though it's really telling how you immediately jumped to the list of female star wars characters that exist in the franchise but never really played a starring role outside of the complete mixed bag that is the expanded universe. There's some horrid ***t in the EU and I'm glad Disney cleaned it up. I think we all have a hard time really seeing the world outside of our direct vision and that instills upon us bias that might make us expect things to work in a certain way. And cry foul when it doesn't really work out that way.[Bunerd|0|0|e8enun7|2018-10-25 06:52:26]
------------>mara jade never played a staring role  for decades the eu was starwars   oh and ashoka is not eu    I think your doing the same thing your projecting  I think your actions will cause failure and instead of appealing to them with a bankable hollywood star you apeal to them how  by convincing them to watch films with unknowns  [CommanderL3|1|0|e8eo701|2018-10-25 06:58:56]
-------------->Oh? Which of the mainline star wars films had Ashoka in them?  >I think your actions will cause failure and instead of appealing to them with a bankable hollywood star you apeal to them how by convincing them to watch films with unknowns  Could you imagine if Star Wars was casted with almost entirely unknowns? It would never have gotten off the ground. Could you imagine if they just got a kid with no real big screen experience to play the star, or had just a carpenter turned bit actor be one of the main leads. Star Wars has never taken chances on unknowns.[Bunerd|1|0|e8eopbz|2018-10-25 07:08:37]
---------------->difference is people like sci fi and it takes time you want to promote films about trans people and have trans people play them     you want to create an entire industry out of nothing because ***ody will finance big films with unknowns  starwars is also decades old,  hollywood has changed since then  the eu is non canon  the clone wars cartoon which ashoka was a lead charcter in canon and she also appeared in rebels[CommanderL3|1|0|e8eoubg|2018-10-25 07:11:18]
------------------>>starwars is also decades old, hollywood has changed since then  Yeah. Hollywood has become increasingly intersectional and aware of how much they shape people's idea of things. If anything it's way easier now to have trans stars than it ever has been because the language of the oppressed is becoming so well understood.  Honestly, you're kind of boring. You have a few biases to work out, but it still feels like you keep just trying to defend an indefensible position.[Bunerd|1|0|e8ep010|2018-10-25 07:14:22]
-------------------->and can you name one trans star  if its easier there should be one main stream one that everyone should know  also hollywood aint anything but greedy its all smoke and mirrors      [CommanderL3|1|0|e8ep42d|2018-10-25 07:16:33]
---->The only problem here is that *you* have expectation that I'm denying and you're trying to reason around them without trying to grasp why I find it so important to stop you from doing so. We can keep doing this forever and I'll still have my way. In a few years, people will expect to see trans stars on the screen, but it doesn't come from relenting now. You seem to think people have set ideas, but we're just heuristic learning machines, picking up our understanding of the world via feedback from the world. When we normalize trans stars, they become normal. It's like, proven science.[Bunerd|1|0|e8epfw8|2018-10-25 07:22:56]
------>I think, getting trans charcters on screen first is a good starting point  but you keep shooting yourself in the foot  americans going to american I guess[CommanderL3|1|0|e8epjxb|2018-10-25 07:25:14]
-------->Why? There have been tons already, doesn't really seem to be doing them any good. Why not give a great trans actress a chance to break out? Redmayne was ***ody untill he made Danish Girl and won an oscar for it, that could have been a chance for a trans actress like Jamie Clayton to get the break out she deserves. Trans characters are the only chance they possibly have and they are not even getting those.[Erebeon|-5|0|e8ecoa9|2018-10-25 03:53:41]

---->Okay, tell the director that he/she can make their movie without scarjo but instead with an unknown trans actor... but with 10% of the budget. That director is out, no movie.[duhhhhdoy|3|0|e8ec7cl|2018-10-25 03:46:19]
------>good, the director isn't trans anyway. *** em  EDIT: just looked it up and its the same guy that made the ghost in the s*** movie with scarjo playing an asian robot. nah. this director can go *** off and ruin someone else's culture. he should make more white people movies.[Speedracer98|-12|0|e8ec8r1|2018-10-25 03:46:55]

I’m sick and tired of this insanely stupid PC culture the world has developed into [boduzefa|0|0|e8ehc0v|2018-10-25 05:06:13]
---->Yeah, you’re right. It’s not like the entire community is of one voice. But the outspoken members of that community show themselves in the foot[duhhhhdoy|1|0|e8eo8cd|2018-10-25 06:59:39]
---->Why do you say that?[duhhhhdoy|4|0|e8e9mit|2018-10-25 03:05:26]
---->No they're not because only the community and people who are already devoted allies will watch them, isn't that obvious? Also are you trans? If you are I mean no offense to you.[NeuroSciCommunist|5|0|e8e9x11|2018-10-25 03:10:03]
------>Not trans but imo this falls short on a few counts:   -The movie isn’t made to win over new allies. People with anti-trans at***udes are unlikely to be swung by a film about a crime lord who uses a m***age parlour as a front for a pros***ution ring.   -You don’t have to be trans, or even an ally to watch a film with a trans character/lead.   -If I was a member of the trans community I’d much rather see an actor that was also trans than get a big name star in for the benefit of people who aren’t trans  -Having trans actors in movies does a lot of good for the community in terms of visibility and representation[GreenPlasticChair|2|0|e8eayi4|2018-10-25 03:26:40]
---->Then what's the demographic? Scar Jo adds a bigger general audience automatically, in whatever she stars in. With a trans actor who may very well do a good job of it, but lacks an equal popularity won't bring as much exposure to what the film is trying tackle.[cheesyqueso|3|0|e8ea58s|2018-10-25 03:13:43]
---->Not if it comes with low advertising dollars and low distribution due to not having Scarlett *** Johansson in it. Now ***ody will give a *** about the movie.[TimeZarg|3|0|e8eafcj|2018-10-25 03:18:15]
---->If you don't want anyone outside the community to see them I guess.  [asimplescribe|2|0|e8ebit7|2018-10-25 03:35:30]
----> Not if the goal is getting non trans people to see it too.  If the goal is to be mainstream, you need mainstream appeal.[Iorith|1|0|e8edytl|2018-10-25 04:13:45]

---->It would be much more palatable for a cis man to be cast in this role because Dante Gill self-identified as a man. Casting a woman in that role has negative connotations in that it implies Gill was just a woman in men’s clothing. Ideally a trans actor would get the chance to be cast in the role, but barring that a cis man would be more suitable than a woman.[ThatsWhatSheaSaid|6|0|e8ed5g4|2018-10-25 04:00:59]
------>Agreed. [Wumbo737|2|0|e8efgw5|2018-10-25 04:37:27]
---->Yeah, the fact that she accepted the role got her some blowback. But it was the casting director's decision ultimately. Thats actually a very good point. [Wumbo737|1|0|e8efmql|2018-10-25 04:39:58]
---->Iirc, she also repeatedly misgendered Gill by using she/her ***ouns.[IStoleYourSocks|1|0|e8enjj9|2018-10-25 06:46:43]
---->Honestly the only criticisms I saw or heard came from people who wanted a trans character to be play by a trans actor. Not because you can’t have a cis actor play a trans role but because that role could be filled by an actor who is actually trans, a group of people who have considerable issues finding success as screen actors.[sirpug145|8|0|e8eeu27|2018-10-25 04:27:32]
------>They're likely proportionately represented in hollywood considering the ridiculously tiny number of trans people in the real world. Someone crunched the number in another comment and statistically there should only be 5 trans actors in the entire SAG which includes extras and a ***-ton of no-names.  Also not every trans person is "out" so we can't accurately tell how many are really finding work. [p90xeto|2|0|e8ef95u|2018-10-25 04:34:05]
---->I think it’s just frustration from trans people because there are some great trans actors and actresses... but they basically never get roles - certainly not roles as straight people.  But when there’s a role for a trans actor, and they don’t even compete for that... it feels bad.  I’m Indian. Until maybe aziz ansari, Indian comedians (and actors) basically rolled with stereotypes. I’m not an actor or anything but I think I’d get annoyed if even Indian roles were played by non Indians... and obviously Indians were excluded from non Indian parts.[madmaxturbator|12|0|e8eedp7|2018-10-25 04:20:18]
------>There's a few great trans actors. There's a million even better straight actors. Want someone else's career to take off? Make them get better. You know why Aziz got famous? Not because he's indian. Not because indian's ***ed and the white people in power gave him his career. No, he was just good, that's all it takes. It's simple, not easy, since he had to be better than millions of wannabe comedians. Literally millions also want his spot, most of them straight white and male. And everyone indian before him wasn't good enough. If they woke up overnight with a race change they wouldn't be good enough either.[Inquisitor1|-2|0|e8einss|2018-10-25 05:26:31]
-------->I'm sure a ton of Indians were proud and could relate to Aziz being Indian though.[Scientolojesus|1|0|e8eljzt|2018-10-25 06:12:16]
---->But it's not really about that. It's about representation for a marginalised minority.  I would've settled for an actor that was actually male in this cir***stance to suit the character's gender (in this case based on a real person), but far too often trans characters are given actors that aren't their identified gender. [dawiz|3|0|e8ekybq|2018-10-25 06:02:39]
------>Unless the entire movie is shot post-op then it's arguably more accurate to have a birth-*** character, no? And even then, unless genitals make an appearance she still might be closer to what the character would look like.  It's not wrong to say plenty of people who transition still look much like their birth ***.[p90xeto|1|0|e8eptz6|2018-10-25 07:30:57]
---->There's no easy answer, but on the extremes, you get truly offensive things like Mickey Rooney in Breakfast at Tiffany's and older blackface "minstrel shows".   I'm going to ***ume you don't want Chris Pratt to play a black man unless it is a parody ala *Tropic of Thunder*.  But Chris Pratt with black makeup talking about his poor upbringing in "the hood" would be offensive right?  Reese Witherspoon playing a WWII Geisha in Imperial Japan, also probably offensive, right?  I'm just making the point that it isn't simply everyone "do whatever they want".  It never has been.   Especially as far as Hollywood goes, it has always been concerned with what will "play" right.    I think it is worth stopping for a moment and considering how many openly straight white actors there are.  And these days there are definitely a lot of openly gay actors, but that is a pretty recent development and there are still many who would rather not openly identify as gay.  So there are a ton of straight white actors and a bunch of openly gay actors.  When you get to asian, black and latino actors there are markedly fewer actors available for big hollywood roles.  When you narrow it down to trans actors, you've got a much smaller group.     So can you see how that small group might take offense, or at least chafe at the idea, of American heartthrob Scarlett Johansson taking on the role?   Or maybe they feel like someone who has actually transitioned will have much more to offer the role than someone who is just "acting".  Yes, I see an irony in that statement, but it is also part of the reason Chris Pratt can't take a serious turn as a gang banger from South Central.  There's always going to be a line of offensiveness in things like performance and music and writing.  And that line is always going to be moving and sometimes it might be too restrictive in your opinion, but I think it's worth recognizing that there probably is a place where things can cross a line for you.  I mean, I think things are too restrictive right now but I'm not sure I care that Johansson can't play a trans person.  It's a bit foggy to me, so I tend to side with the people who want less Johansson and more representation.  She's in so many movies!   And yes, there seems to be something different to me between a white person playing a black person, and a straight person playing a gay person.  They are not the same thing, but they are all part of a frothy mix of iden***y and power and there's just not going to be a simple rule.  And somewhere in there is a "cis" person playing a trans person – and I'm not really sure how I feel about it but I tend to think it would be great to give a trans actor a shot.  Something about it being a true story seems to be important here also.  Finally, I would guess that Robert Downey Jr. today would not take on the role of the Australian method actor playing the Black American Soldier – and that is really unfortunate.   I think that was a wonderful performance and a great sendup of the acting profession and American racial issues.     TL;DR – it's complicated![ovideos|3|0|e8emkm6|2018-10-25 06:29:18]

------>It was just quick typed out comment, I realized the mistake but the general concept came across and I'm not going to edit it at this point. If people can't see past an honest mistake then whatever.  Thanks for heads up anyways.[p90xeto|1|0|e8epohl|2018-10-25 07:27:47]
---->I mean, I think we can all agree a blond white dude shouldn't be cast as Martin Luther King, Jr for obvious reasons.  I think if you approach the issue from the perspective of how absurd it would be to have, say, ScarJo playing Napoleon Bonaparte because "it's all just acting, anybody can play anybody", you see why people would take issue with something like a cisgender man playing a historical transwoman.  There's already a precedent set for avoiding absurdly inaccurate miscasting with regards to race and ***, we just don't really think of trans people as a group that needs that kind of care.[desacralize|3|0|e8ef4s9|2018-10-25 04:32:11]

[This is Scarlett Johansson.](https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/lovelace/getty/74747581.jpg)  [This is Dante "Tex" Gill.](http://www.dagospia.com/img/foto/07-2018/dante-tex-gill-1-1037297.jpg)  Are you sure you quite thought this one through, mate?[Murgie|3|0|e8en2lo|2018-10-25 06:38:06]
-------->It would be bad casting because the white guy isn't black and ScarJo isn't a man.  If it was purely about aesthetics, then we could just paint the white guy brown and slap some prosthetics on ScarJo and go about filming.  But anyone trying the first would be chased out of town on a rail, and with the second, people would be extremely critical of why anyone would go to all the trouble instead of just, you know, getting a male actor.  If one sees those reactions to racial and ***ual miscasting as reasonable, why not with transgender miscasting?[desacralize|3|0|e8egfok|2018-10-25 04:52:17]
---------->But so if they had a male play a ftm transgender character would you agree with that?[Soloman212|3|0|e8egsjz|2018-10-25 04:57:42]
------------>I've read from some transgender advocates that that would at least be better than a ciswoman playing a transman, but an actual transman actor seems to be the preference.[desacralize|6|0|e8ei6xl|2018-10-25 05:19:19]
------------>A lot of people would prefer it. A man playing a male character. [garrygra|7|0|e8ehkj1|2018-10-25 05:09:55]
------------>Most trans people on reddit agreed that a cis man playing would have been acceptable.  Imagine I told you about a movie where the main character was an overweight 80's gangster and looked like [this](https://i2.wp.com/newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/thedigs/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tumblr_n0u8o8TqFk1rr5swxo1_1280.jpg?zoom=1.25&w=508&h=503&ssl=1).  He ran several m***age parlors and was a pimp who was ultimately convicted of tax fraud.  Who would you cast?[Zetalus|2|0|e8ek67l|2018-10-25 05:50:03]
---------->Lots of times white guys have been painted brown. It is only about aesthetics. Why they dont do it is because sometimes it's cheaper to get a good already brown guy, or because there would be race riots, not because good actors suddenly can't act when they dont look like their characters. Thing about trans people, is that they are just like all other people. They look, behave, think, feel the same, and unless you look in their birth certificate and underpants, you can't tell the difference between them and anyone else.[Inquisitor1|0|0|e8eja8b|2018-10-25 05:36:06]
------------>The race riots wouldn't be prevented by the white actor being really really good at the role.  It's a question of whether or not one thinks that sort of anger and frustration is justified.  If one really thinks it should never matter who plays what role so long as it's a human being with acting talent, male, female, black, white, because we're all people who behave and feel the same, okay.  But most people don't actually believe that, and I was pointing out the inconsistency of that alongside thinking it doesn't matter who plays transgender roles.[desacralize|3|0|e8ekab0|2018-10-25 05:51:53]
------>I don't agree. As long as the open-minded watcher isn't pulled out of suspension of disbelief by your choice then go for it. I can't imagine a scenario where a white guy could play MLK but I also couldn't imagine Hamilton working as it has. Putting a bunch of arbitrary limitations on art so a tiny subset of whiners don't get upset is not a direction I agree with.  If Scarjo can pull off this trans character and get the story out to more people then I couldn't care less that she isn't trans in real life. Actors are just paid to make me believe for a couple of hours and if they pull it off I don't give a ***t about what plumbing they have/desire.[p90xeto|3|0|e8efy7r|2018-10-25 04:44:49]
-------->There's no limitations, if somebody wants to make a film with a white guy as MLK and ScarJo as a transperson, they're more than free to.  But both are going to be heavily criticized for their artistic choices by their audiences, as art always is.[desacralize|2|0|e8ehc3i|2018-10-25 05:06:15]
---------->You can't ***ume how they would be received. I agree it'd be very hard to make an MLK film with a white actor but some creative people might find an awesome way to do it.  And we don't even know if ScarJo would have been heavily criticized, we only know that a tiny vocal minority of whiners disliked it.  [p90xeto|1|0|e8ejw0e|2018-10-25 05:45:36]
------------>I mean, anything under the sun is possible, but a wise person probably shouldn't bet their life savings on just anything, or their career.  It's up to them, though.  Since the tiny vocal minority of whiners was so insignificant, maybe ScarJo reconsidered things all on her own, and we shouldn't blame the whiners for the film we'll never see.  Artists do think twice, after all.[desacralize|2|0|e8el5ha|2018-10-25 06:05:50]
-------------->I blame the whiners for the movie getting cancelled. They let what they as best be the enemy of good. I'd bet good money that a scarjo-led movie would have made a much larger impact than one led by a no-name or no movie at all.  If advancing "trans" stuff was their goal then they failed miserably.[p90xeto|1|0|e8eprql|2018-10-25 07:29:38]
------>Have you ever heard of the existance of broadway? Theatre? Troupes where men play all roles, troupes where women play all roles, no characters genderbent to fit the actor. Most modern movies mistakenly strive for photorealism of some "image" of people(and everything else besides people) so that's the only reason Scarlett can't play Martin Luther King. She could bind her chest and wear makeup to make her skin dark, but that would incite race riots for no reason. She could easily play non gender-bent Napoleon, though he would be a Napoleon with a really pretty face. Unless they lay on some thick makeup. Hell we had missis doubtfire. Anyone can play anyone. They just dont because sometimes the consequences aren't worth it.[Inquisitor1|1|0|e8ej4ch|2018-10-25 05:33:33]
---->>That's making the ***umption that a straight person can't play a trans character, is that a precedent trans people want to set?  Uhh, no, it's making the ***umption that an attractive woman shouldn't be cast to play someone who's FtM.   [This guy, specifically.](http://www.dagospia.com/img/foto/07-2018/dante-tex-gill-1-1037297.jpg)  FtMs don't want to be represented by Scarlett Johansson any more than MtFs want to be represented by a bearded lumberjack in a dress. Is that really all that stupid a request to have?   Do you *really* consider that to be comparable to saying that white people can't write about black characters? And I don't even know where this bizarre notion of yours that trans people can't be straight is coming from. [Murgie|2|0|e8emslo|2018-10-25 06:33:11]
------>The physical appearance isn't the most common argument being made here by far but I don't think similarity in looks to source material is the biggest goal of casting either.  People are saying a cis person is automatically bad representation of a trans character, that's hullabaloo and absolutely on par with saying any white person writing a black character is a bad character. [p90xeto|1|0|e8epydy|2018-10-25 07:33:36]
---->you apparently think “straight” is the opposite of “trans” so you’re pretty out of your depth in this conversation [tribblesquared|2|0|e8emyz5|2018-10-25 06:36:17]
---->Agreed. But people love to be outraged.[ruggednugget|1|0|e8edcns|2018-10-25 04:04:06]
---->This statement appears to be based in privilege. I don’t mean that as a put-down, but I invite you to consider it. Presently 99.9999% of actors cast in big Hollywood movies are cis. There is very little representation of trans people in Hollywood. So when a role comes around for a trans character, sure a good actor can probably play it well, but this is a role to introduce more representation of trans actors in the mainstream. If trans characters are being played by cis actors, then at this point cis characters won’t be played by trans actors either.   As for white writers developing black characters, sure they can do it, but tbh a white writer couldn’t fully understand the experience of a black character. They’d likely have to consult with black individuals on their experiences in order to fully shape the character.   Because straight white cis people are in a position of privilege, our representation has never been threatened. 99% of movies, tv shows, etc feature white cis people. Only very recently have lgbt characters been featured more prominently. So we also need to make room for actors in the industry to fill these roles[merpsicle|1|0|e8epd6n|2018-10-25 07:21:28]
---->Who said anything about being straight? ***uality =/= gender. And when bad representation of your group is a very large factor in the overall oppression of your group, yeah it becomes something you give more than half a ***t about. We won't understand trans people if we make no effort to include them in their own narratives. This is where harmful stereotypes arise.  Your view is presenting a fallacious snow-ball.[vbcxnmz|1|0|e8eegxt|2018-10-25 04:21:40]
------>Show me where this bad representation of trans people is a "very large factor" in the oppression of trans people.   And you're ***uming with no evidence that no one involved in telling the story was trans, if I had to pick I'd MUCH rather have writers/directors who were trans on this project than actors since they have a bigger effect in my opinion.  And the straight thing was just an example, unless you're telling me this nonsense stance doesn't extend to gay/bi/queer characters also.[p90xeto|4|0|e8ef2n0|2018-10-25 04:31:15]
---->It’s a different situation with trans characters though. Trans people live with constant accusations that they’re just pretending to be something they aren’t. This isn’t something that gay people etc experience.   No matter how well a non-trans actor plays a trans character, the fact that they aren’t really the gender they’re portraying reinforces these preconceptions that trans people are just pretending, even if it’s on a subconscious level.  [scratchmellotron|1|0|e8engkl|2018-10-25 06:45:14]
------>I think gay/bi/pan people would have a different take than you on that topic. The same "it's a phase" "you're just buying into a fad" was/is used for all of them.[p90xeto|1|0|e8epjgj|2018-10-25 07:24:58]
-------->I am gay. There's a slight element of that but not to the extent that I have a problem with straight actors playing gay characters.[scratchmellotron|1|0|e8eppjg|2018-10-25 07:28:23]
---------->Now that I've had a second to think about it, I disagree even more. Considering the "gay while in prison" and "bi while in college" tropes I'd say that gay/bi are much more often characterized as "pretending".  [p90xeto|1|0|e8eq0yu|2018-10-25 07:35:03]

---->Or you could ask trans people how they feel about it instead of making their decision for them.[PearlSquared|-1|0|e8edo7b|2018-10-25 04:09:09]
------>No. I refuse to think trans people own cinema, even cinema related to them. I don't claim to hold dominion over straight cinema and think everyone, including trans, bi, queer, whatever people can join a discussion.  This strange-*** move towards segregation is nonsense and absolutely the wrong direction in my opinion.   I feel you missed my point above, but using your logic only straight people should get to weigh in on casting choices on "straight" roles and only straight people should be considered for them. Just stop with the bull***t.[p90xeto|12|0|e8edxjv|2018-10-25 04:13:13]
-------->You’re missing the point. Trans people don’t get roles as straight people. They also can’t even get roles as trans people.  So it kind of sucks, doesn’t it? To be a trans actor and see that talented trans actors aren’t even considered for trans roles?  They’re not saying they own trans films.  The best example I can give is race based. It’s not the same, but it’s sort of like that. If only Mexican people got roles as Indians, even if there were good Indian actors... are Indian actors not supposed to at least voice their opinions?  Why are you so aggressive in making ***umptions? Moving towards segregation? What...? They’re just asking studios and directors and actors and actresses to consider trans people for roles where they’re relevant.[madmaxturbator|4|0|e8ef9d5|2018-10-25 04:34:11]
---------->That's not what the comment I replied to was about. They ***umed that a cis person couldn't play a trans role, that Scarjo could only be "Bad representation".   And this isn't actors but the 24-hour twitter whine-fest just finding something new to complain about. Trans people are MASSIVELY rare in the population and not immediately obvious so we don't know if they're represented or not in cinema. Another comment crunched the numbers and found in all of SAG there should be 5 trans people, that includes extras and no-names galore. [p90xeto|1|0|e8eg56j|2018-10-25 04:47:47]
---------->> You’re missing the point. Trans people don’t get roles as straight people.  Maybe they should p*** better and be better actors than the m***es of cis actors? There's literally millions of times more cis actors than trans actors. Just like you dont get women competing in men's olympics, they're allowed to, they just get really really worse results.  What's wrong with mexicans getting roles? Any roles, doesn't matter wether as indians or anything else. Just proves those "good" indian actors are worse than mexican actors. Or harder to work with, demand too much pay, whatever. For every Indian actor who didn't get the job, there's a hundred thousand white actors who didn't get the same job, or their own job. Work is business, not a charity, nor a lottery.[Inquisitor1|-2|0|e8ejhwv|2018-10-25 05:39:29]

------>That's a terrible ***ogy. Scarjo was absolutely physically equipped to play this role unlike your example.  And blackface was just as much about how the actors acted in "blackface" roles as the person not being black in the role. They would play into the worst and most racist stereotypes of black people while pretending to be them, that absolutely wouldn't have happened in this case.  If you care to educate yourself on it there is tons of info.[p90xeto|7|0|e8eeigd|2018-10-25 04:22:20]

------>Black face doesn't mean make up and prosthetics. It means a specific giant white lips tarblack costume. It is entirely acceptable to have a white actor play a black character. Or a black actor play a white character. Vin Diesel is black, he doesn't even need make up. He might need "black face" if he was to play martin luther king though.[Inquisitor1|-1|0|e8ejsyq|2018-10-25 05:44:17]
---->Yeah man I hate seeing real trans people on tv, they're awful to look at, so let's just have them all be played by cis people. While we're at it let's bring back black face. Why can't a white person play a black character? Why would we want black people telling their own stories? One you think about this for more than a few minutes you realize how patently stupid these stances are. [Trevie3|-4|0|e8eejy3|2018-10-25 04:23:00]
------>This is definitely heading towards a productive conversation. I've already got more comments than I can reply to, try to discuss things in good faith in the future for a better chance at a real response.[p90xeto|4|0|e8eevum|2018-10-25 04:28:19]
-------->Ok, I will try that. Can a white person do the research and write a good black character or story? I'd say yes, definitely. And furthermore I'd say that although it's rare, cis people could produce, direct, and write a good trans character and story.   However I see an enormous difference between a cis person writing a trans story and a cis person playing a trans person. Trans people have for the most part been excluded from our media, and historically have only been brought into stories as punchlines or as a silly example of ***ual deviancy. Trans women have usually been portrayed as tricking men into having *** with them. The songs Lola by the Kinks, Funky Cold Medina, the movies (spoiler) The Crying Game, (spoiler) Ace Ventura, Trainspotting, and so on. In all of these instances the trans characters in question have been played by men in drag.   This might seem a little unusual when you think about the fact that trans actors actually exist. However they rarely appear in mainstream media. Why is that? Maybe they universally suck at acting, but I'd argue that it's actually because there is some level of discrimination in Hollywood against trans people. Actors have to get past the long casting process. Hollywood writes very few trans roles, even compared to the proportionally low number of trans people ([around 0.6% of Americans](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/health/transgender-population.html)). I've definitely seen over 200 movies in my life, over 200 tv shows and over 200 episodes of various tv shows. I don't think 1/200 of the main characters have been trans, or even 1/200 of the speaking characters. I've seen many commercials, etc, I'm sure you get my point. I argue that trans characters are underrepresented, so what does that have to do with Scarlet Johansen? Isn't it a good thing that she's playing a trans man and bringing a trans character to the big screen?   Well, good for who? I think it's implied it's good for trans people as a whole. Here's why I argue that it isn't.   1. Trans actors exist, so she takes that job and takes a job from a trans actor. Big deal, it's one actor, but this just reinforces the transphobic casting process in Hollywood. This would be a problem we were talking about yellowface or blackface, but for some reason certain people don't find this objectionable when it comes to trans people. Perhaps because certain people don't think trans people are real, and that Jared Leto playing a trans woman is no different from a trans woman playing a trans woman, because trans women are actually just men. 2. A woman playing a trans-man reinforces the idea that trans people are ***ual deviants who basically want to trick you and molest/rape you because it harkens back to the time not very long ago, I mean literally like 10 years ago, when all trans people in the media were trans women played by cis men who wanted to ***ually ***ault men. Furthermore, is it a coincidence that the movie being made features a trans-character who m***ages women? I argue that Scarlet Johanson playing this character is the 21st century equivalent to Mickey Rooney playing I. Y. Yunio***. The character is a stereotype built upon a history of bigotry.  3. Representation matters. Trans kids exist, and they watch tv and movies. Almost every movie, tv show, video game, whatever I've ever watched has been about someone I can easily imagine myself as. Why was Crazy Rich Asians such a big deal to some people? Maybe someday there will be a movie called Crazy Rich Trans-Women (lol) or something like that, and trans kids and adults alike will get to see themselves portrayed as three dimensional characters, portrayed by actors who are like themselves.   I wrote this fast so please read it in good faith. Also anyone interested in representation in Hollywood should check out the book [Reel Inequality by Dr. Yuen](https://www.amazon.com/Reel-Inequality-Hollywood-Actors-Racism/dp/0813586291). Finally I would like to apologize for repeatedly misspelling Scarlet Johansen's name, for some reason I just find it incredibly hard to spell. [Trevie3|2|0|e8ehah8|2018-10-25 05:05:33]
---->Trans women normally have at least a slightly different body type than cis women do. We don't have white characters play blacks with blackface makeup as the go-to, why should trans women be played as anything but themselves as a first preference?

You're welcome to select the wrong people to portray whatever roles, but the people from whatever you are portraying are going to say they think it's ***ing ridiculous.

-------->A) I did say Tim Curry's *character*  B) He (*the character*) was from Tran***ual, Transylvania; that doesn't make him (*the character*) transgender[MelisandreStokes|8|0|e8ee81c|2018-10-25 04:17:47]
---------->That's what I thought you meant, the character, Dr Frank-n-Furter, was a (sweet) transves***e, as he tells us so sweetly in the song.  I didn't say the character was transgender.  I mention the movie as an example of an actor doing a remarkable, memorable (though not necessarily realistic) job portraying someone unlike himself, i.e. acting.  Likewise John Hurt did a marvelous job portraying a gay character (not transgender) in Kiss of the Spider Woman, despite not actually being gay.[cattleyo|-4|0|e8eev0q|2018-10-25 04:27:57]
------------>I haven't seen the john hurt one. But transves***es are just cross dressers and curry did cross dress for the role, sooo...[MelisandreStokes|8|0|e8ef3z0|2018-10-25 04:31:50]
---->There's an argument to be made that if trans actors can't get work playing cis characters, they should at least get to play the roles they're actually more qualified to play.   The bigger issue, though, is how the cis actor cast is always the character's ***igned-at-birth gender rather than their identified gender. Most other trans people I've talked to would be alright with cis women playing trans women or cis men playing trans men, but having cis women play trans men and cis men play trans women is insulting and continues to misinform people about what transition really looks like.   Try this: [search "Dante 'Tex' Gill"](https://www.google.com/search?q=dante+%27tex%27+gill&client=firefox-b-1-ab&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjPyvzgraDeAhVs6oMKHW8mCewQ_AUIDigB&biw=1920&bih=966) and then [search "Scarlett Johansson"](https://www.google.com/search?q=scarlett+johansson&client=firefox-b-1-ab&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjntLmnrqDeAhXD6YMKHc5_BSEQ_AUIDigB&biw=1920&bih=966). What similarities exist between the two that make you think she would be the best choice to play him? That casting decision only makes sense if you don't believe he's a man and you're trying to alter his story to fit that version of reality. [Asuradne|29|0|e8ec6zx|2018-10-25 03:46:09]
------>Perhaps Dante would be better played by someone older and less feminine in appearance than Scarlett; though it's easier to makeup a youngish woman to look older and less feminine, much easier than the other way around; certainly it's easier than making up a man to look like a woman.  I don't agree it's insulting to use an actor who has a different ***ual iden***y to that of the character they play.  Acting is looking the part and acting the part; the actor doesn't have to literally be the character.[cattleyo|1|0|e8ecy78|2018-10-25 03:57:56]
-------->> certainly it's easier than making up a man to look like a woman.  Did you look at those pictures? Dante Gill looks nothing like a woman. I see cis dudes every day who look more like women than him.   > I don't agree it's insulting to use an actor who has a different ***ual iden***y to that of the character they play.

-------->I'm well aware of what makeup can do, particularly in well-framed still photos.   My issue is that the same people who'd never want a cis man to play a cis woman or vice-versa, outside of a comedy, are the ones saying "it's just about casting the best actor for the role" while continually ***fting the goalposts.   If Dante Gill were a cis man, even looking exactly the same, everyone here would find it downright *absurd* to consider casting Johansson for this role. There's literally no reason to do it except the ***umption, unconscious or not, that trans men aren't "really" men. [Asuradne|12|0|e8egt2h|2018-10-25 04:57:56]
---------->I mean.... Cate Blanchett played Bob Dylan. And I don't have the screenplay for the Dante Gill biopic but there may have been pretty valid reasons to cast a woman for the role over a man.[TheRabidDeer|1|0|e8ehq68|2018-10-25 05:12:19]
------------>> Cate Blanchett played Bob Dylan.  She was only one of six different actors to do so in that film alone, and the rest were men. The film was clearly and unambiguously not challenging or undermining Dylan's iden***y as a man.   Edit: Scratch that, none of those six characters were *actually Dylan*, they were "Dylan inspired" and each "represents a different facet of Dylan's public persona". Blanchett played "Jude Quinn", a character clearly bearing parallels to Dylan but still nominally distinct from him. That is a world away from casting one lone cis woman directly as a real man who actually existed.   >And I don't have the screenplay for the Dante Gill biopic but there may have been pretty valid reasons to cast a woman for the role over a man.  The promotional material called Gill a lesbian and said he was "disguising herself" as a man. I would be thoroughly, thoroughly surprised if Rupert Sanders (who, remember, was also the director behind the awful Ghost in the S*** adaptation) was approaching the subject matter in an informed and respectful way.   It's kind of frustrating sometimes to feel like even when it's pretty cut-and-dry that someone is saying or doing something ignorant that there'll be a bunch of people jumping in to say, "Now hold on, I've given this subject very little thought before now so I'm going to ***ume the same is true of you. How do you *know*, with absolute certainty, that this hack writer falling into predictably offensive tropes doesn't actually have a really good artistic reason for not listening to the people he's writing about? In the presence of reasonable doubt you cannot convict someone to life in prison, or publicly criticize their decisions, which is basically the same thing!" [Asuradne|5|0|e8eil2g|2018-10-25 05:25:23]
-------------->> The promotional material called Gill a lesbian and said he was "disguising herself" as a man  This is probably because in [Gill's obituary](http://old.post-gazette.com/obituaries/20030109gillp4.asp) that is how he is referred. Terms were different back then as the dialog about ***ouns did not exist, but Gill referred to himself as a lesbian. If the movie is trying to stay true to the time period then it is not inaccurate. And who are you to judge Rupert Sanders on what he was going to do with the film? We have basically ZERO information about the movie aside from who was planned to star in it and who is directing it...[TheRabidDeer|0|0|e8ejcdg|2018-10-25 05:37:01]
---------------->> This is probably because in Gill's obituary that is how he is referred.  Gill didn't write his obituary. It, like many things written about him during and after his life, misgenders him consistently and deliberately.   >but Gill referred to himself as a lesbian  Can you source that for me? I have no doubt that he may have used the term at some point in his early years, before he had begun to live publicly as male, but past that I've seen nothing to suggest he called himself a lesbian.   >If the movie is trying to stay true to the time period then it is not inaccurate.  If the movie wants to present unquestioned the bigotry of people in and around Gill's life, to an extent that borders on condoning it, then that's one thing, but this film was shaping up to misrepresent Gill's *own* self-professed iden***y.   >And who are you to judge Rupert Sanders on what he was going to do with the film?   Someone who's sick of my community's, my friend's, my family's stories being misrepresented and exploited by people who care too little to even listen to us, to even stop and ask us what our lives are really like.

------------------>> Gill didn't write his obituary. It, like many things written about him during and after his life, misgenders him consistently and deliberately.  So you knew Gill personally then? You know their life story, how they labeled their ***uality, themselves? Why don't you write the story of Gill? Because the only thing I know is from their obituary which contains information from friends and family.  >Someone who's sick of my community's, my friend's, my family's stories being misrepresented and exploited by people who care too little to even listen to us, to even stop and ask us what our lives are really like. Who don't even bother to get to know us but still think they're qualified to tell the world about us, without a care for the harm they've done to us after they move on.  So what do you know about Rupert Sanders? Do you know his story? His life? Do you know the writer and how much they probed family/friends while writing the story? So far all I see from you is the only ones able to write, direct or star in a movie about a transgender person is also a transgender person. Which, if you think about it, doesn't make much sense. Does a movie about racism towards african americans have to be written by african americans? 42, Amistad, Fences, The Help, are all terrible misrepresentations?[TheRabidDeer|-2|0|e8elptt|2018-10-25 06:14:59]
-------------------->Trans people being misgendered in obituaries by "well-meaning" but unaccepting or misunderstanding family is an unfortunately very common problem, especially in decades past but by no means has it gone away.   If you're looking for a different perspective about Gill in particular, here's an excerpt that provides a slightly better one:  >[This is often a point of contention for queer historians: in eras with no language for transness, how can we tell the difference between trans men and women fleeing patriarchal subjugation? But a careful look at Gill’s history, as told through contemporary Pittsburgh news, easily sets the record straight. Though writers at the Post-Gazette, Pittsburgh Press, and other papers were careful to call him “Miss Gill” and “a woman who prefers to be known as a man,” even issuing corrections for errant uses of “he,” Tex made it clear to anyone who would listen who he really was. One of the few who stood up for his iden***y was Friedman, who, when asked by a court why she used male ***ouns for her client, responded simply “that’s what he considers himself.”](https://www.them.us/story/the-true-story-of-dante-tex-gill)  As for the strawmanning in your last paragraph, I've repeated over and over that I'm okay with anyone telling our story as long as they're willing to *listen* to us, the people the story is about, something you so far seem to be either unwilling or unable to do. [Asuradne|5|0|e8emmf3|2018-10-25 06:30:11]
---->> As for the strawmanning in your last paragraph, I've repeated over and over that I'm okay with anyone telling our story as long as they're willing to listen to us, the people the story is about, something you so far seem to be either unwilling or unable to do.  I don't think I have even once demonstrated an unwillingness or inability to listen. You are, however, making many ***umptions about myself and the movie. You are also ignoring questions, probably because there is no answer for them because ****ody* knows the answer to them. Do you know the writer? Do you know how much research has been done for the film? Have you seen the screenplay?  Thank you for the link to that article though, it also brings up a point I mentioned earlier that ***ouns had not entered the discussion at the time of Gill's life. It was interesting to read what Friedman thought of him.[TheRabidDeer|0|0|e8enayn|2018-10-25 06:42:23]
------>At the start of this conversation, you did a p***able impression of someone conversing in good faith, better than most manage. You didn't know when to cut your losses, though, and the tactics you're being forced to fall back on make it unfortunately clear that you're disagreeing on principle rather than happenstance.    >You are also ignoring questions,   Did you ever get me your source on that "Gill called himself a lesbian" comment?  >probably because there is no answer for them because ***ody knows the answer to them. Do you know the writer? Do you know how much research has been done for the film? Have you seen the screenplay?  As I thought I made clear earlier, I don't need to know the director's social security number and blood type to say, "I have concerns about this movie, including but not limited to the concern that it will misgender the person it's about and the concern that it will reflect poorly on the trans community."   >it also brings up a point I mentioned earlier that ***ouns had not entered the discussion at the time of Gill's life.   Subtle implication that the very clear and unambiguous statements by Gill about his ***ouns and iden***y can safely be ignored.   >It was interesting to read what Friedman thought of him.  Subtle implication that Friedman is the only person who thought that of him, suggesting either:  1. You didn't read the whole article and haven't sought out any others, or  2. You are willfully misrepresenting facts.  Either way, I think what you can contribute to this discussion is running rather thin.   *Edited a spot of grammar[Asuradne|0|0|e8ent0w|2018-10-25 06:51:37]

The only thing I have at all tried to hold you accountable for is your views on the movie, which is what this entire discussion started with. And I am trying to hold you accountable for that because there is little known about the movie so all you are doing is speculating. And you are free to speculate, but know that nothing about speculation can be argued. I mean you have already said the director will make no attempt to be faithful based upon Ghost in the S*** (which actually directly copied scenes from the original, but his version did suck because of other reasons) and EXTREMELY early promo material released not by him but from the studio.  But you know, you can continue to think I am some ignorant person that is unwilling to open up to other views or listen to your story.  I will just say though, it is so weird to me that you completely ignore a thank you and instead try to read into it. I think that is the first time I have had that happen to me in a discussion when somebody gives me new information.[TheRabidDeer|1|0|e8epjke|2018-10-25 07:25:01]
---->Again, most of the people in the trans community that were against ScarJo's casting were against it because they thought that if a cisgender person had to play him (the main character), it should be a male actor because casting a female actor undermines his chosen iden***y. This isnt the same as having to cast a real russian spy to play black widow. This is like how Hollywood casts Chinese people to play Philippino people because to Hollywood, Asian people all look the same.[raiskream|21|0|e8ec3k5|2018-10-25 03:44:41]
------>>This is like how Hollywood casts Chinese people to play Philippino people because to Hollywood, Asian people all look the same.  Filipino people are ethnically related to Chinese people.  Having a Chinese person play a Filipino person would be like have a Spanish person play a Mexican (which happens all of the time), or an Australian play an American (which happens all of the time) or a German play an English person (which happens all of the time).[pewqokrsf|-2|0|e8ela4h|2018-10-25 06:07:56]
---->Marginalized people have the right to define good representation however they decide to.   Having the overwhelming majority of trans roles go to cis actors perpetuates the invisibility of trans people by keeping trans actors out of Hollywood in any meaningful way. [Bricingwolf|10|0|e8ec9hd|2018-10-25 03:47:15]
------>Trans people represent 0.5% of the population.[pewqokrsf|0|0|e8eljbp|2018-10-25 06:11:58]
-------->Do you have a point?    Also, that number is impossible to trust, because people are still literally getting killed for being trans, so there is no way in *** we actually know how many trans people are hiding themselves. [Bricingwolf|4|0|e8enhbc|2018-10-25 06:45:36]
---------->A-list Hollywood stardom is a small group.  The statistical chance that a sizable representation of any group that small being trans is unlikely.  It is entirely possible that none with the requisite talent and skill for A-list stardom currently exist.  When I see people clamouring for trans representation, I feel this point is missed.  Most people seem to want a trans for every cis, or in a similar vein, identical (as opposed to proportional) ethnic representation.[pewqokrsf|0|0|e8epgzp|2018-10-25 07:23:32]
------------>Nope, you aren’t listening to people. [Bricingwolf|0|0|e8eq5ke|2018-10-25 07:37:48]
---->Yeah, but as it stands right now, trans actors can’t even get trans roles, let alone any other roles. If trans actors were scoring roles left and right in Hollywood it would be one thing, but all else being equal why *not* cast a trans actor in a trans (or any other) role?[ThatsWhatSheaSaid|3|0|e8ecpqa|2018-10-25 03:54:19]
------>Movies cost so much to make, producers aren't doing it so they can give acting jobs to people who deserve a break; the movie has to make money, they'll cast it accordingly.  That doesn't always mean a big-name actor, they'll take a risk on an unknown sometimes - if the producer thinks they're perfect for the role or on the cusp of a meteoric career - but why would a producer choose an actually-trans actor for that reason alone ?[cattleyo|0|0|e8edk3q|2018-10-25 04:07:21]
-------->I mean, you’re not wrong per se, but then you’re stuck in this endless loop of hiring a cis actor in a trans srole because they are no trans actors with big box office draws, but there are no trans actors big enough to bring in the numbers because Hollywood keeps casting cis actors over trans actors.  Look, Rub & Tug was never going to make a gajillion dollars in the first place, and tons of art house films are made solely because someone wanted to make it with zero expectation of financial success (I’m looking at you, Martin Scorsese). If Hollywood can lose $250 million on a movie like John Carter, surely they can stand to take a chance on an exceptional trans actor just waiting for their big break.[ThatsWhatSheaSaid|3|0|e8eiyrz|2018-10-25 05:31:09]
-------->If Rub and Tug required ScarJo to make money then I'd rather not have it made.  It's better to be represented in a good movie not a ***tty movie that everyone will forget in a few years.    If you don't think people agree with that statement, look at the ATLA community and their denial of the poorly made movie.  Had that movie been good, they would have paraded it around to the older crowd to show how amazing the story is; now they pretend it doesn't exist in the hopes that no one thinks it's connected to the original series.[Zetalus|1|0|e8ej0c1|2018-10-25 05:31:49]
---------->Scarlett might not be the perfect actor for the role, quite possibly her presence would nudge it towards being a ***tty movie.  But the perfect actor who would truly make it a good movie, whoever that might be, need not be trans.  They just need to be a good actor.[cattleyo|2|0|e8ejnxo|2018-10-25 05:42:07]
------------>No one said the role had to go to a trans man.  Yes a trans man would have been preferred but people would not have been so upset if the original casting was a man.  [Zetalus|3|0|e8el2pr|2018-10-25 06:04:36]
---->Because representation matters. There’s a trans actress out there who can do just as good of a job as Scarjo and she deserves the opportunity to play that role. The problem is there isn’t room for anyone in Hollywood besides the prototype actors and actresses and that needs to change [dogsstevens|1|0|e8edlob|2018-10-25 04:08:01]
------>There are a lot of actors/actresses that could play a lot of roles as good as a major star but they don't get roles. That's a problem of the industry using star power for movies rather than a problem of representation IMO.[TheRabidDeer|1|0|e8egf1j|2018-10-25 04:52:01]
-------->I would argue it’s both and it won’t change unless we as audience members ask for change [dogsstevens|1|0|e8ej2xl|2018-10-25 05:32:56]
---->Because of representation. There are very few famous trans actors. If trans actors aren’t even being casted to play trans characters, then there is no real representation of trans people in the industry[merpsicle|1|0|e8ep0uc|2018-10-25 07:14:49]
---->Why ask that question and not the reverse? Why can the actor not be trans in this role, or in a non-trans role even? Representation matters. There are plenty of trans actors out there who deserve an opportunity.   The reason it was blowback on Scarlet especially was because she still took the role even after the blowback she got from Ghost in the S***[branta|1|0|e8eqklu|2018-10-25 07:46:51]

------>>Are there good trans actors?  To avoid misunderstandings, I want to unpack this into two different questions:  Q: Can trans people be good at acting?   A: Obviously yes, as much as anybody else. In fact, a lot of us get a lot of "practice" while we're closeted, while we're still trying to pretend to be our ***igned-at-birth gender and before we publicly admit who we really are.   Q: Can casting directors locate qualified trans actors?  A: Trans actors aren't as plentiful as cis actors, but casting directors sure aren't trying very hard to find them. The ones who are around have been vocal about how hard it is to get work, even work that seems like it would be particularly well-suited to a trans actor. It's these sorts of systemic issues we'd like to see improved on. [Asuradne|1|0|e8ejm0x|2018-10-25 05:41:19]

---->By that logic, any woman could play Captain America and any man could play Wonder Woman.  A trans man is still a man, and a trans woman is still a woman. When you look at a casting sheet and it says “mid-twenties blond female”, you would cast a woman, not a man. So why would you cast a man in a trans woman role? All that does is perpetuate the myth that a trans woman is nothing but a man in a dress.[ThatsWhatSheaSaid|1|0|e8edolx|2018-10-25 04:09:21]
------>So if you cast a woman to play a trans woman that is fine right?[Sinfall69|1|0|e8efwl2|2018-10-25 04:44:08]
-------->Ideally you would first consider a trans woman for the role of a trans woman, since there are so few opportunities for trans actors at the moment. Baring that, a cisgendered woman cast as a trans woman would definitely be preferred to a cis man cast as a trans woman. By casting a woman in the role, you are validating that character as the gender they identify as.[ThatsWhatSheaSaid|1|0|e8eg8x1|2018-10-25 04:49:23]

------>>By that logic, any woman could play Captain America and any man could play Wonder Woman.  Sure why not. Genderbending is a staple in comics anyway.  >All that does is perpetuate the myth that a trans woman is nothing but a man in a dress.  This is highly subjective.

-------->No. It's exactly that bad. A poor media representation stifles trans people from transitioning, increasing their suicide rates, and can bias cis people from recognizing transgender needs or outright giving them a motive and a target for abuse. It literally can get us killed. We have a really high mortality rate and experience a lot of hate crimes.  Hollywood tries to condense a complicated and existentially enlightening concept such as transitioning or finding out you are dying of a disease the government refuses to actually do anything to treat because you belong to a stigmatized minority group, or because the government has isolated you into a city where you can't grow your own food, can't get decent work, and are put into a position where any action you take will be interpreted and used against you in the worst way. But the nuance is lost when translated to the screen, and so a disease that had kicked off your involvement in activism, or trying to do the best you can in a system that is stacked against you, or the crippling agony of your brain constantly screaming "something's wrong here" that never quite makes sense until you have that moment where you tie it to gender and it suddenly makes sense, and you realize it has a lot to do with how the brain is encoded to handle the different hormone levels different people have. The disease becomes a person who destroys themselves through their own choices, the gang banger is a stereotype whose life you can just throw away; he was an extra anyways, and the person with a medical condition they fixed becomes a morose individual seeking a better life on the opposite sides of the gender.  Stereotypes remove your ability to empathize with the people who those stereotypes are meant to depict, and that most certainly doesn't help them stay alive.[Bunerd|1|0|e8emwku|2018-10-25 06:35:05]

---->That's... not a great take.  Asian Americans care about asian representation in the American film industry. The live action GITS adaptation was made in the American film industry and was a missed chance to cast an Asian-American actress. Their solution of having it be a Japanese woman inside the Scarlett Johansson s*** arguably made it worse.[cascadegreen|2|0|e8edvj8|2018-10-25 04:12:22]
------>Asian-Americans are "gaijin" in the eyes of the Japanese - including Japanese-Americans.  Japanese also don't go for the "all Asians are the same" stuff that Hollywood does, like casting Korean Randall Park as a Chinese dude in Fresh off the Boat.[BubbaTee|1|0|e8eg3hm|2018-10-25 04:47:05]

-------->Yes, this is terrible take.  Japan proper doesn't worry about Asian representation because it's not an issue there. They're more likely to be upset about casting a Chinese actress as a Japanese character or freaking out about a actor in a McDonalds commercial bowing in the Korean manner (happened a year or two go.) [cascadegreen|1|0|e8ef9lr|2018-10-25 04:34:16]

---->Yes, I know it's a cyborg.  I know the representation in the anime.  Still, the twist in the live action movie to have her be an Asian girl that's encased in the ScarJo s*** seems like a terrible mistake, and her being a designed cyborg, the highest ideal of beauty, and they choose to model it on a white woman? We have to admit the implicit message of beauty that's sending, whether intentional or not.[cascadegreen|1|0|e8epwfn|2018-10-25 07:32:25]
---->I mean... you pretty much listed *every* big Asian actor in Hollywood except for maybe Constance Wu after Crazy Rich Asians, and two of them got their start overseas (Jackie Chan, Maggie Q) before getting a chance here.  > I'd bet money they're over-represented compared to their population in the US.  [Actually not the case, according to a study by USC.](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jul/31/hollywood-diversity-report-usc-no-progress-2017) And sometimes those roles are "the wacky side character" and not starring roles. Crazy Rich Asians was the first Hollywood movie with an all Asian cast since 1993's The Joy Luck Club.[cascadegreen|3|0|e8eeydz|2018-10-25 04:29:28]
------>I listed all the ones I could think of off-hand, I also found an online list that had many more I recognized but went with the ones in films/TV I watch. There are many more Asian actors than you think.  As for the study, it only looks at what they consider "top" films and doesn't address television at all. And even then they found it was pretty *** close, only .8% off of population-level representation ***uming they include Indians as "Asian". If you opened that up to all film or included TV in some way it might change. Also I feel they should have looked at the SAG rosters as another source for representation.  The article doesn't link the full study and a google search couldn't bring it up but they don't seem to say Asians aren't represented at population levels and without the study I can't check for myself.[p90xeto|1|0|e8efncy|2018-10-25 04:40:15]
-------->> I listed all the ones I could think of off-hand, I also found an online list that had many more I recognized but went with the ones in films/TV I watch.

Is non-conforming really the same mechanism? I'd think it would be something some people might be more likely to grow out of or even be A-***ual and just see that as no gender. I'm not saying it's not "transgender" but I just think it's very different and has less stigma or desired altercations to oneself making there really being very little consequences if someone wants to appoint themselves it - which might seem like a crude thing to say but teenagers rebel and people that want to be part of something but be counter-culture will do it if they can. IDK enough about it but their conclusions start looking a little more up in the air to me after seeing that. At least break it out for future reference. I'd also be curious to see if that number really spiked from old to young people, even more so than the opposite gender identification. I was looking but do you know if the raw data is available?

For every trans actor who doesn't get a role there's hundreds of thousands of cis actor who can't land a role, and dont deserve to either.[Inquisitor1|2|0|e8ekkao|2018-10-25 05:56:24]
---->obviously you need to stay rational.  It's not irrational to use a woman in a role in which the person used to be a woman physically and maybe not have even medically transitioned (IDK the details of the story).  Do you consider Boys Don't Cry to be a failure?[MoistDemand|1|0|e8efrml|2018-10-25 04:42:01]
------>I think most people opposing this would say it’s a product of its time and that we can be better now in hindsight. It doesn’t rob the movie of its importance but recognizes where it fails to be timelessly relevant.[TheTinyTim|1|0|e8ensj2|2018-10-25 06:51:21]

-------->I think it's far from "always being a big factor".[p90xeto|-1|0|e8efa7m|2018-10-25 04:34:32]
---->There are outliers, I'm sure, but I'm speaking about in general. I'm no transphobe, just speaking frankly. Cosmetic surgery just isn't up to snuff yet.[p90xeto|2|0|e8eeahf|2018-10-25 04:18:53]

---->I think, from the perspective of a trans person attempting to find work in the entertainment industry, when roles written for trans characters are handed to cis actors, it both takes incredibly rare opportunities from actual trans people and dismisses them as "basically cis" - whether a conscious decision or (obviously most likely) not, it still perpetuates the incredibly harmful belief.[ThatTwoSandDemon|1|0|e8eiug3|2018-10-25 05:29:18]

---->Exactly. Now people who legitimately do want to do harm to the trans community have ammo to throw. Now they can just write off the entire trans community as self-victimized and whiny when that obviously isn’t the case. [dungeon_plastered|4|0|e8eaw0d|2018-10-25 03:25:36]

-------->Again, this would not solve the issue, but bring attention. Isnt the end goal to solve the issue of representation? You dont solve the issue by giving it more awareness, you solve it by actually casting the correct minority to represent said minority.  [Darrison|0|0|e8eiekn|2018-10-25 05:22:34]

---------->I thought you said it could be successful without her. Are you gonna make it? [grammartist|2|0|e8ehpda|2018-10-25 05:11:58]
------------>Again why is this an issue with me? How is aiming your argument against my personal finance relevant to this conversation? I want correct representation in movies, if they dont do it, someone else will. Crazy Rich Asian is a great movie with representation, by mostly unknown (to the west) asian actors. Look at how successful that is. [Darrison|1|0|e8ei77a|2018-10-25 05:19:26]
---->People from the lgbt community can act too, and more fitting for the role. [Darrison|2|0|e8ef2im|2018-10-25 04:31:12]

---->Because they can’t get roles in the first place, and their are few transgender leading roles, so when there finally is one and it goes to an actor who has no issues getting parts at all it’s the industry saying they have 0 interest in going near the trans community. [FreeMichaelLindsay|3|0|e8ekw6i|2018-10-25 06:01:41]
------>Why do you care so much about what Hollywood does with their time and money? If you’re getting offended about ***t like this, then you may be focusing your self iden***y too much into one attribute about yourself or someone else. [dungeon_plastered|0|0|e8elglu|2018-10-25 06:10:44]

---------->I didn’t say you were mentally unstable. I just said you may be focusing too much on things that don’t really matter. I’m not saying trans people shouldn’t be represented. I’m just saying that it makes sense why someone would choose ScarJo over a trans actor. I’d like you to name some trans actors with the acting chops of ScarJo. Did any of them even audition? There’s an infinite amount of reasons why they didn’t pick a trans actor.[dungeon_plastered|1|0|e8elzv3|2018-10-25 06:19:33]

------>Isn’t that kind of how people do it though?   Like am I interested in a movie about a trans main character, sure.

---->Who in this scenario is white? [DidIststststutter|1|0|e8ejkra|2018-10-25 05:40:46]
------>White members of the LGBTQ community. It can be segmented further into each individual letter of LGBTQ+ as well. My point is that some people within the community wrongly think that issues that are unique to other minority communities (and other people within the LGBTQ umbrella) are less important. For example, a not insignificant number of white gays and lesbians have checked out of advocacy since the legalization of gay marriage, ignoring that POC within the community face unique issues. One look at grindr says everything you need to know about racism within the gay community.[oldspbice|1|0|e8ekl5t|2018-10-25 05:56:47]
-------->But that is racism in general. It's not a subgroup of the LGBT,  it's just racism...  Also, how is it a revelation that people who use grindr are shallow to the point where skin color is something to put worth in?[DidIststststutter|1|0|e8ekydx|2018-10-25 06:02:40]
---------->Yes, but racism and ***phobia often interact. Regardless of whether someone is black and straight or white and gay, both are minorities in the eyes of racist, ***ist, and ***phobic power structures. Support between communities is essential if progress is to be made. All for one and one for all, and all that.[oldspbice|1|0|e8ell2n|2018-10-25 06:12:48]

-------------------->That's not what you said, though. You said a 'good actress'. Not a 'popular actress'.  I agree that Rub & Tug was only going to happen from a major studio if it had star power in the lead role (it's the precise type of 'transformative' role that the Academy bends over backwards to honor). But that doesn't mean it was only going to be good if it had star power. [Mushroomer|1|0|e8e9j2h|2018-10-25 03:03:54]

IMO I'd rather have a lot of people seeing the film about these issues with an actor that is nothing alike than very few people outside of that niche seeing the film but with a trans actor.

The manga is a bit heavier on style because it's easier in print, while the anime's style is softer for easier animation.

-------->Nah, just some controversy about the casting of her movies and "whitewa***ng", where roles originally written for minorities were given to her.  It's wildly overstated, frankly. It just so happens that Hollywood leans left so leftist critiques, even from only a few people, carry more weight but I doubt either GitS (where she played the role of an Asian woman) *or* Rub and Tug (where she was set to play a transman) had any major impact on how most of America or the world saw her.   For one: most people don't notice or care about these things. GitS is not some iconic American property, even though it is an incredibly respected anime in Japan and with anime fans (who are not the general population). Most of the public doesn't see or know the issue. Rub and Tug never even got produced.  One might as well say that Emma Stone's public image was knocked off track by her playing a half-Asian woman and getting some backlash. It wasn't, not really. Most people only saw La La Land and most people know ScarJo as Black Widow, the rest came and went.  [Tsegen|-1|0|e8e7lwx|2018-10-25 02:32:56]

-------->Probably because she got criticized for Ghost in the S*** for not having a Japanese lead, then that transgender role she had to refuse, so why not go back to portraying a Russian super-spy.   Edit: someone want to explain how I’m wrong, as opposed to downvoting? [IFapToCalamity|-3|0|e8e75nf|2018-10-25 02:25:40]
---------->Lmao when it's laid out like that, it really does sound even more ridiculous.   "We want equality. Anyone should be able to portray anything they want in any role, regardless of gender or race"  **3 decades later**   "She's a white cisgendered female trying to portray a trans male, typical Hollywood **whitefemalewa***ng**. Fuck the old white men who make the decisions #NotMyHollywood".   I realize that different people should have access to more roles, but campaigning against people for not being a specific race or gender is just as bad and undesirable. It is really cool when someone with a certain background or experiences steps into the shoes of someone with similar ones, and it can be extremely powerful and moving, but that should never be expected or forced. We shouldn't shame people. What's next, only black actors can portray black people? Only asians can portray asians? Isn't that just as racist as what society has been trying to move past in the last hundred+ years?   [xChris777|1|0|e8e97dm|2018-10-25 02:58:41]

If she just turned the film down, you'd never hear about it. Happens all the time. This is a calculated press release to enhance her image to make her harder to criticize. If you don't get that, you don't get how Hollywood works.[hamsteronsteroids|-7|0|e8e8kvx|2018-10-25 02:48:36]
-------------->I think you're really overthinking the white-wa***ng issue from GITS, because it was a pretty small non-issue. It was a couple of publications saying ScarJo shouldn't play a technically race-less robot, ***ody gave a *** about that, or the movie itself.   Also, sure, this may be a calculated PR move, but you're acting as if Scarlett Johansson can't have her own opinions and be against something, especially something as ***ing disgusting as the treatments of certain persons in Saudi Arabia. You have very cynical outlook, don't get me wrong, cynicism can be a great trait to have, it's good to question pre-conceived notions and hegemonic ideas, but too much of it turns you into a cold ***hole, and sometimes a clueless dumb***, and in this case, it makes you seem like a clueless dumb***, I'm not saying you are, but when you act like you need to question things like this and go "but the lefties" people aren't going to take you seriously.[EasternKanyeWest|3|0|e8e9434|2018-10-25 02:57:12]

I'm sure it's just a coincidence that before Jay-Z and Beyonce both had al***s coming out, rumors about their relation***p started swirling around in the press.  I'm sure that Kanye showed up at Tmz completely unannounced and it had nothing to do with his upcoming Ye al***.  I'm sure that Scarlet felt the complete need, on her own, to just open her mouth up against the Saudi's in a PR statement. Lmao. Gimmie a ***ing break. [hamsteronsteroids|1|0|e8e9y65|2018-10-25 03:10:35]
------------------>Bro, Holy ***, I gave you an out to stop making a fool of yourself and you're just tripling down on this bull***t.  Your examples of Beyonce and Jay Z are questionable, and I say that as a m***ive hip-hop head, I honestly don't doubt they've had some trouble, considering the music they've both released that explicitly touches on Jay's infidelity, see Lemonade and 4:44.  Your Kanye example straight up sucks a whole *** ***, because ***ody has ever questioned whether or not Kanye uses controversy to promote his al***s, he's literally done that forever, that's his ***ing shtick, and it sucks sometimes as a fan, but it's the way he does things.  Also, do you think what the Saudis are doing is excusable? Scarlett Johansson is allowed to find it inexcusable, as most people do and all people should, and as a celebrity who holds a small amount of power in the public eye, she should use her platform to discuss issues she has.[EasternKanyeWest|1|0|e8eatyn|2018-10-25 03:24:43]

---------------->It wasn't an attempt at character ******ination, I'm only still answering because you're blatantly wrong and being completely ignorant.  My whole point was you're overly cynical of something, that while it may have been a PR move, is contributing to an important conversation, and your dumbskull tried to act like it was because Johansson was tired of "lefties" because of a nearly nonexistent backlash for a movie from that's almost two years old and ***ing ***ody cared about.  Just shut the *** up dude lol.[EasternKanyeWest|1|0|e8eeqsr|2018-10-25 04:26:05]
------------------>Ah, so since her motivations were selfish and for publicity, we still give her props because you think it's going to open a discussion among the american people into the behavior of the Saudis?  Lmao. Okay, bro. Not like people haven't been telling the Left about how Saudi Arabia has been throwing gays off roofs and oppressing women for years.

Obviously you gonna do what you're gonna do, and that's cool, but I'm not going to keep arguing here dude, it's honestly not worth it for me. I hope you can one day stop giving such a large amount of ***s to arguments online lol.

However the other two are policies. Voter ID laws are Republican policies aimed at helping voter suppression against minorities. Voter ID laws could also be linked to white supremacy, just saying.

-------------->I think there has been a very consistent history recently that casting appropriate ethnicities in films is financially rewarding. As much as it baffles redditors, people love seeing mirrors of themselves portrayed in movies, especially in movies that reflect on their own backgrounds. And you even proved it in your own comment. Casting big stars that are also people of color that fits within the narrative works and casting a film totally with a non-white actors was still a financial hit. Having people of color in your cast isnt just good for public image, it's also just financially sensible at this point. [TrekMek|15|0|e8eecke|2018-10-25 04:19:48]

Khashoggi's son has had to receive condolences from and shake the hand of the man who ordered his father's torture and murder. Some Saudi princes have reportedly been jailed for mentioning this case to King Salman.   A revolution isn't going to happen. There's also no powerful enough rival within the House of Saud to challenge the King or have the Crown Prince punished.  They'll get away with it just fine. [kmidre|32|0|e8ecrua|2018-10-25 03:55:14]
------>I think Erdogan and the SA/Turkey relation***p is going to be the thing to watch here, and the potential for some kind of negative result for SA. Turkey was responsible for leaking the information about the murder, and recently Erdogan all but accused Prince MBS of being behind it.   I agree nothing within the country will change, but it seems like they may potentially lose an ally over this depending on how things go in the near future. If Erdogan has more up his sleeve we might see the situation get worse for the Prince.   Or the situation ends here and isn’t in the news by next week. [SamNesMonster|4|0|e8eevwu|2018-10-25 04:28:21]
-------->Realistically I doubt it will be the end of their alliance. SA is still a major investor in Turkey. Erdogan, hardly a human rights champion himself, will try to drag out concessions from Saudi Arabia.   MBS is really the key factor here -can anything dislodge his power after the 'anti-corruption' purge? How much of a grudge is he going to hold against Turkey if/when he succeeds his father?

---->China.  Chinese production companies injecting money into Hollywood movies has been steadily rising over the past decade.   Half of the movie-theatres in the US are own by the Chinese state   Also, Chinese movie-stars are often migrating into Hollywood films. Keep in mind these actors are furnished by the actual state, not independent studios.  The box-office returns from a Chinese audience justifies equally bountiful production budgets. Disney and Fox are huge distributors in China, evolving epic franchises as MCU, PoC, Bond, Star Wars, Star Trek, MI, etc.  And if the Chinese investors also gain profit from an American audience? Bonus.[ReginaldJohnston|1|0|e8emvfc|2018-10-25 06:34:32]

---->Does she? Specifically the crimes? Because it seems to be that the Israeli-Palestine conflict is extremely complicated and that could and is said about anyone who says they have any amount of support for either side.   Unless she specifically said she supported a murder or something, in which case I’ll admit I’m wrong, but it sounds to me like you’re vastly simplifying and overstating her beliefs. [Rpanich|19|0|e8eak2y|2018-10-25 03:20:22]
------>She became a spokeswoman for SodaStream whose parent company had illegally settled on Palestinian land. She said she knew about the factory before she signed up to be a spokesperson.   Source: https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/16/scarlett-johansson-stands-by-sodastream-deal  So not a murder, but a clearly illegal and immoral behavior that she’s ok with.   Edit: [oh guess I'm getting downvoted](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/024/574/Screen_Shot_2017-11-06_at_12.41.31_PM.png) [Adhiboy|-4|0|e8edb0m|2018-10-25 04:03:23]
-------->Im not saying that it’s right, but that is a FAAAAAAR cry from endorsing crimes against humanity. [Rpanich|7|0|e8ee0so|2018-10-25 04:14:36]
---------->Maybe not directly, but illegal settlements are only fuel for the Israel/Palestine conflict, which will result in the loss of thousands of innocent lives on both sides. It's really not hard to make the connection at all. [Adhiboy|-1|0|e8eekgh|2018-10-25 04:23:14]
------------>In the same way you could blame anyone buying any smart phone for being directly endorsing Chinese factory worker treatment; yeah you could, but that’s really stretching it. [Rpanich|3|0|e8efqh0|2018-10-25 04:41:33]
-------------->That’s a false equivalence. In Scarlett’s situation, she wouldn’t be buying a phone, she’d be sponsoring the owner of the Chinese sweat shop. Buying SodaStream soda would be like buying the phone in your ***ogy. [Adhiboy|0|0|e8eg2ak|2018-10-25 04:46:35]
---------------->I realise that, my point was she’s so far distances from the people actually responsible for that, being 99 people away and being 100 people away is not that different. The responsibility for what happened is in the people who did it, not on someone 20 degrees removed. [Rpanich|3|0|e8eggi4|2018-10-25 04:52:37]
------------------>How is she far removed though? She's a spokeswoman; if the company finds any sort of success, a significant amount of it will be due to her. The company in question is undoubtably exhibiting behavior which will lead to innocent people dying. Therefore, it's not really much of a stretch to conclude that her endor***t may indirectly play a significant role in civilian casualties.  [Adhiboy|0|0|e8eh9ls|2018-10-25 05:05:10]
-------------------->And again, by that logic, anyone who knows about this and bought a soda stream has directly given money to a company that did this, Therefore, it's not really much of a stretch to conclude that their purchase is tantamount to an endor***t which may indirectly play a significant role in civilian casualties.  [Rpanich|3|0|e8ehhz8|2018-10-25 05:08:49]
---->My whole comment was about this. The very first sentence:  "She's a spokeswoman; if the company finds any sort of success, a significant amount of it will be due to her."  Keyword here is "significant". Individual consumers do not play a significant role in the company's success. They *do* play a role, however, and this is why you see some people boycotting brands. But they're individual contribution is not 1/1,000,000th the size of a celebrity endor***t. A company can live or die with the right endor***t; a single person choosing to buy a product absolutely will not have any impact comparatively.   Can you really not see a huge difference?[Adhiboy|2|0|e8ehtxl|2018-10-25 05:13:48]
------>I see the difference: I believe that morality is based on the action. I’m a deontologist. You’re defining morality by its outcome. Utilitarian/ consequentialist thinking. I believe that line of thinking is incorrect which is why we are opposed on this.   I don’t know if you study ethics, but in a grander scale, your line of thinking leads to “the ends justify the means”, and that’s why I personally disagree with it. [Rpanich|2|0|e8ei8cf|2018-10-25 05:19:55]
-------->I'm not particularly well versed in anything like what you just said lol. I never took a cl*** in it or studied it in my free time. I mostly reason with the lessons I've learned throughout life and what I believe to be right. I definitely don't have a set of hard and fast rules that I use to judge everything.   I could maybe understand the argument that "how is a person supposed to know x would lead to y would lead to z", but in this specific case, the person we're arguing about definitely knew about the settlement ahead of time. I do not know how anyone could argue that she wasn't aware of the implications of supporting a company that had made such controversial decisions. In this case, I don't know how you're *not* supposed to judge morals by the outcome.   I don't understand how anything I've stated supports the "ends justify the means" line of thinking, but maybe I'm just misinterpreting what this saying even means. From what I understand, the statement means that small, inconsequential immoral acts are ok as long the help society in the grand scheme. I don't really believe I fall into this line of thinking, nor do I think anything I've said today backs that up. [Adhiboy|-1|0|e8ej22n|2018-10-25 05:32:34]
---------->What I’m trying to say is where do you place the blame, and where do you judge it to stop. Is one person littering ok because it doesn’t have a big effect? If someone kills 500 innocent children to save 501 is that alright?   Also when you look at the outcome, maybe soda stream employee more people due to this success, and those people were able to feed their families. Some gave to charity. Do we get to credit scarlet with those as well?   It seems that the lines you’re drawing are arbitrary.   The reason we study ethics in this was is so you understand not “what” you’d do, but “why” you’d do it: You need to sort out your ideas without contradictions, because that’s the only way to know what you truly believe; because if you don’t know what you believe deep down, you can’t have principles to stand up for. [Rpanich|2|0|e8ejjzh|2018-10-25 05:40:25]
------------>If the line I was drawing was between 501 deaths and 502 deaths, then yes, that'd be arbitrary. The line between endorser and consumer is so well defined that I don't know whether you're ignoring it willfully or if you genuinely can't tell.  Can we just clear this up, one final time; you do understand the monumental difference between supporting a company by buying their products and supporting a company by being the star of an ad campaign, right?  &#x200B;  \>Also when you look at the outcome, maybe soda stream employee more people due to this success, and those people were able to feed their families. Some gave to charity. Do we get to credit scarlet with those as well?  &#x200B;  There's no reason any of this wasn't possible on legally owned land.  &#x200B;  And I mean in this in the least rude way possible, but for someone whose trying to sell themselves as an expert in ethics, you seem to fall into a lot of false equivalences and willful ignorance.[Adhiboy|1|0|e8ek4yn|2018-10-25 05:49:31]

This has been a re***al, and you keep going back and explaining your original point. I get it, I’m saying just because you’ve defined two things are “different”, you’re still making arbitrary lines.
