------------>That's the problem with Trump. We can try to get angry at something he does, but before it can even register in the public perception, he somehow tops it with something worse.

When they get here, they will be dealt with according to our laws. (Laws which he has done **zilch** to change, even though immigration was priorties 1,2, and 10 of his campaign) And nothing will happen because our laws our fine.   But somehow this *nothing* is being talked about by more than ***ody because this unignorable jack*** is talking about it and so is his propaganda network. And the snowflakes always win. Meanwhile actually substantial, important things (healthcare, climate change, our nations *actual* security, etc etc etc) all fall by the wayside.   Even if Trump wasn't a grotesque buffoon who does damage every possible chance he gets..Even if he did nothing at all- the fact that we are experiencing 4 years of absolutely nothing substantial even halfway being contended with seriously and thoughtfully is such an opportunity cost it boggles the mind.

However, back in 2009-2012, it wasn’t as common as it is now, so there is no evidence that Clinton or any of the previous Secretary of States email was hacked. Yes, it was negligent not to consider that possibility.  Now, 6 years later and light years of advanced technology, The Trumps - all of them - just flaunt our National Security.

-------->I remember a This American Life story that kind of suggested that the reason the emails thing was a soft spot was because Clinton isn’t very technically savvy. She uses a blackberry for everything because she’s been shown how to use it, and a more secure system would have forced her a little past her abilities. The emails thing could have been easily dropped if she just admitted that she isn’t good with computers and her staff had to adapt the system for her, but that may have been the point of pressing her on it- to get her to admit she was a little inept about something. So she just ignored it.  Now we get the same exact thing, but more inep***ude. [Toynbee1|1|0|e8em5wp|2018-10-25 06:22:20]

---------->Yeah, kind of. Except in this case Trump is leaving the door to the US wide open for wolves and foxes. Objectively more harmful.  Oh, but you're also flatly wrong, anyway. The left **has** taken firm action against its own who've been accused, compared to conservatives. Where's Al Franken? He was not endorsed for re-election by Obama, like Roy Moore was by Trump. Not confirmed to the Supreme Court.   I think by choosing to not see the difference, you're simply being a terrible hypocrite, and you're projecting your hypocrisy onto people you irrationally hate.[easternmost-celtic|1|0|e8emd6a|2018-10-25 06:25:43]

They were as mad about e-mails with Hillary as they were about Obama golfing.

------>Yes because 33 THOUSAND emails of cl***ified information and government secrets but 2 phone calls are exactly the same.[FearOfBees|1|0|e8epbd6|2018-10-25 07:20:27]
------>Sort of, the small exception being that The President is the ultimate cl***ification authority.  He could decl***ify everything if he wanted too, so it's kind of impossible for him to leak cl***ified information in the same manner she did.  Although some might argue that by saying it in an insecure manner that the same implicit argument that says he can't be punished for leaking it would also imply others couldn't either since it would no longer be cl***ified.  Although I'm not sure if they can "recl***ify" something after it has been uncl***ified.  If so, one could argue that when he says it in an insecure channel he implicitly de-cl***ifies it and re-cl***ifies it before and after saying it.       The Secretary of State would have no similar protection except in situations where she were the cl***ification authority.[Rhawk187|-1|0|e8elhw0|2018-10-25 06:11:19]
------>I'm STILL ***ing mad about that.    But it was all about "malicious intent" and not...  the federal standards according to NISTIR 7359 which states  "Federal executives may face administrative and/or legal actions for not complying with security mandates. Security is ultimately the responsibility of executive leaders such as agency heads and program officials."  Charges should have been brought against HRC.  But because they weren't, we have a new legal interpretation that's going to get rammed up everyone's *** every time someone opts to ignore this ***t.  "But he didn't mean for anything to happen, so it's all good."  Bet the ones defending the Clinton Decision are regretting that now...  They'd have had first-rate material to impeach President Trump.  She should have went to ***ing jail.  end-of.[retardrickshaw99|1|0|e8emfuj|2018-10-25 06:26:59]
------>No, we were mad because she was essentially an employee of the government.  Any other employee would have been charged with a crime, but because she was Hillary Clinton, they decided not to charge her because of "prosecutorial precedent" (FBI's words, not mine).  Comey admitted the crime fit the strict definition of the statute, but because ***ody had ever been charged with it, they wanted to continue that precedent. Again, not my interpretation, that's the FBI's own statement on the matter.  It was the hypocrisy and special favor that was maddening.  If she was president, she would have had complete authority to run the private mail server, because the president is the ultimate decision maker with regards to cl***ification.  Edit: Also ask yourself, what was her motivation to run a private email server.  Perhaps convenience of course, but how does that reconcile with FOIA requirements?  FOIA is a really important part of transparent government, and it's practically impossible to enforce if someone hides their emails from regular governmental oversight.[furrier69|-11|0|e8ekdxd|2018-10-25 05:53:33]

------>No. Contrary to Reddit belief, it is not the same. He is POTUS and she was not. Security stems from POTUS. POTUS has legal right to do whatever POTUS wants in regards to security.  Her POTUS could have pardoned her or decl***ified whatever she leaked, but she was not POTUS herself, so she didn't have the authority.[washor|1|0|e8enfh8|2018-10-25 06:44:41]

---------------->The Republicans were founded as an anti-slavery party in 1854. The Democrats can trace their lineage back to the Democratic-Republicans (not that they share anything ideologically in common beyond in many later years), but the GOP really can't trace itself to them.   You could probably stretch it to say they have some genealogy from the Whigs, but they aren't the same party, and the Whigs that would eventually found the GOP certainly weren't the DRs, as they evolved in opposition to the Ds (who had evolved from the DRs) following the era of Good Feelings and the collapse of the Anti-Jacksonians.   So to claim the GOP relation to the DRs requires saying that the people who founded it used to belong to a party, that decades prior had absorbed the remnants of a breakaway faction of Democratic-Republicans.   Which really isn't much of a lineage claim. [Precursor2552|35|0|e8ehyot|2018-10-25 05:15:48]
---------------->Despite the name, the Democratic Republican Party (DRP) wasn't related to the modern Republican Party at all. The DRP split after the 1824 election (which was between 4 different DRP candidates, and was the first time that the winner didn't win the popular vote). One of those two splits ended up becoming the Democratic Party, and the other became the National Republican Party, which, despite the name, has nothing to do with the GOP - they became the Whigs (the main opposition to the Democrats when the GOP was formed, and the party the GOP replaced.)[beenoc|16|0|e8ehzof|2018-10-25 05:16:14]
---------------->Nope. That's not how it happened. The Democratic Republicans eventually became the Democratic party in the 1820s. The Republicans did not split off from that party. The Republican party was founded in 1854. It came about independently due to hating Nebraska (I'm only half-joking) and they called themselves Republicans.  I can see why you'd think they were one party that split, but that's just a coincidence.[KallistiEngel|6|0|e8eimlg|2018-10-25 05:26:01]

-------------->Well there has been a lot of back and forth over the years but there was a definite ***ft in the 1960's.

------------>They *sort of* flipped. Democrats took up the cause of civil rights. Republicans began a long slide into today's racist cesspool.

I'm defeatist if they're attached to the propaganda, though I don't know how to separate them because you have to convince them that they need to change their routine, which is ~4 hours of their day. That is a tall order to say "just cause" and, naturally, the propaganda has inoculated them changing the channel.    It is a catch 22. [emptynothing|2|0|e8elnxu|2018-10-25 06:14:06]
-------------->If you've ever had a job in sales one of the things you learn is that people don't believe in facts, they believe in people.  You can make people buy things based on complete nonsense. Why is that? It's not because it's correct, that's for sure. It's because you are telling them something they want to hear, then you just append whatever bull***t you want to sell on to that. That takes getting to know the people you are selling to and being flexible with the truth.  If you treat a conversation like an exchange, it's much easier to get someone to become receptive. No offense but what you are doing in your case sounds like shoveling ***t in their ears. It's no wonder they plug them, even if it's correct. The only people that tend to listen to when being told what to think are children. Adults are a little more stubborn than that.  It's important to remember that people want to be heard more than they want to listen. If you can mask what you want them to listen to in an echo of that, you will get results.

-------------->You cant change someone's strong opinion by immediately taking a counter position against them. You have to be more manipulative than that.  You need to be on their side, convince them that not only do you have the same beliefs as them, but that you know more about them as well. Then further into the discussion you can lead them gently to start critically thinking or seeing the other side since you've established yourself to them as an authority and they are agreeable with you.   Saying things like "Ya I used to think that too, until I saw... " are great ways to subtly steer them right. You will never be able to convince someone like that in a single conversation where you are adversaries, in the same way they couldn't convince you.[BigDaddyDeck|0|0|e8ekwv8|2018-10-25 06:01:59]

They're purposely ignorant and is fine electing a rapist into the supreme Court even though investigations into him was impeaded by the whole house. They're seriously brainwashed.

I no longer believe it's worth the effort to try to talk to them- in general, they don't argue in good faith, they refuse to face facts, and they are more than willing to tolerate the slide into fascism to keep white men on top. Moral leader***p? Not important (unless you're hammering a Democrat for its lack). American allies? Not important (unless you're hammering a Dem for failing to back them). Facts? Don't exist (unless the Dems are lying). I hate to say it, but *** if I can figure out how we can heal this divide.

-------------->Honestly, part of the reason they won't listen to you is because they've been told that they only believe what they believe because they're stupid and/or ignorant for so long and about so much that they just roll their eyes every time someone comes in with attempts to "educate".  If they disagree with the dems on healthcare, welfare, drug policy, abortion, etc, it must be because they are uneducated and not because of their principles (unless they're bigoted) or reasoning (unless they're stupid). And having been told that even their opinions that they've put the most thought and research into are just ignorant so often (and with the explanations attacking straw men), they've started to ignore you.  So now if you come across as trying to "educate," they'll immediately ***ume you're just another arrogant dude who thinks he's smarter than them even though you didn't bother to try to understand their views in the first place, and ignore you.   By all means, try to spread facts, but if you come in with a "well acktshually" and look down your nose, you'll just make them ***ume you're another guy who attacks without understanding, and so they'll ignore you beyond smirking a bit.  If you want any success, you can't approach this as "trying to educate the poor dumb republicans." You have to approach this as trying to have a discussion, where you legitimately listen to what they say, actually think about it, and don't write it off without hearing what the particular individual you are talking to at that moment has to say and evaluating it.   Which you might personally do, but most people I've run into who consider themselves political educators of the m***es have approached this from a "I'm right, you're wrong" angle - which is fine, everyone believes that, except they tack a "and you should also know that I'm right because I'm smarter than you and listen while I educate you" on the end instead of "but clearly you believe the same about yourself, so lets have an honest discussion and get to the bottom of this."[FerricDonkey|1|0|e8en5i5|2018-10-25 06:39:34]

-------------->> clean public image  True, but the GOP specializes in digging up old dirt and, if needed, taking it out of context to make it sound bad.  >Here are a few tastes of what was in store for Sanders, straight out of the Republican playbook: He thinks rape is A-OK. In 1972, when he was 31, Sanders wrote a fic***ious essay in which he described a woman enjoying being raped by three men. Yes, there is an explanation for it — a long, complicated one, just like the one that would make clear why the Clinton emails story was nonsense. And we all know how well that worked out.   Then there’s the fact that Sanders was on unemployment until his mid-30s, and that he stole electricity from a neighbor after failing to pay his bills, and that he co-sponsored a bill to ***p Vermont’s nuclear waste to a poor Hispanic community in Texas, where it could be dumped. You can just see the words “environmental racist” on Republican billboards. And if you can’t, I already did. They were in the Republican opposition research book as a proposal on how to frame the nuclear waste issue.   Also on the list: Sanders violated campaign finance laws, criticized Clinton for supporting the 1994 crime bill that he voted for, and he voted against the Amber Alert system. His pitch for universal health care would have been used against him too, since it was tried in his home state of Vermont and collapsed due to excessive costs. Worst of all, the Republicans also had video of Sanders at a 1985 rally thrown by the leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua where half a million people chanted, “Here, there, everywhere/the Yankee will die,’’ while President Daniel Ortega condemned “state terrorism” by America. Sanders said, on camera, supporting the Sandinistas was “patriotic.”   The Republicans had at least four other ***ing Sanders videos (I don’t know what they showed), and the opposition research folder was almost 2-feet thick. (The section calling him a communist with connections to Castro alone would have cost him Florida.) In other words, the belief that Sanders would have walked into the White House based on polls taken before anyone reallyattacked him is a delusion built on a scaffolding of political ignorance.  Source: https://medium.com/@sashastone/ten-reasons-bernie-sanders-would-not-and-could-not-have-beaten-trump-b596674c1c93  Not to mention, like the guy above said, he's an agnostic socialist Jew. I can't think of any three words that would galvanize the Republican base to vote than "agnostic/atheist," "socialist," and "Jew." Maybe Muslim.[beenoc|13|0|e8eiav2|2018-10-25 05:20:59]

------------------>He should have planned to utilize other resources than the Democratic Party several years earlier. Everyone and their children knew Hillary was going to run for President in 2016. The GOP had 25 years to prepare for that moment.   Bernie should have planned to make a run for the primary, gather a following (both which he did), and then run for POTUS as an Independent with a full head of steam and individually donated funding to support it. He did not have to halfheartedly throw his support behind Hillary if he didn't agree with the outcome. The thousands I donated were directly to his campaign, not the DNC, same with millions more of us. This is what my donations helped support? Donald Trump and the GOP wiping their hindquarters with our beloved nation, the beacon of democracy.

For some reason women are much harder on other women then on men.   The left needs fresh blood.  Clinton came out of complete left field in the 90s and took out H W when he had had a 90% approval rating.

------>Take it a step further. I believe it's on purpose. Trump plays stupid while Putin gets what he wants.  Putin: Use the phone I tell you to.  Trump: B..b.but...  Putin: ...  Trump "Ok ok."  This is an extremely easy way for Putin to get what he wants from Trump and for Trump to maintain deniability.  I'm sure extreme damage has already been done. Secrets that can't be untold.  The Republican party ***ed this country over. Only question is if it's beyond repair.[Replicaindigo|20|0|e8ebw7e|2018-10-25 03:41:28]

-------->You'd think so, wouldn't you? I mean, he can't just choose to fly around on his own plane, or drive around in his own car on his own, due to security issues. Not sure why the phones don't fall under the same kind of rules. The fact that he refuses to listen to the experts around him regarding phone security is just another example of his absolute idiocy and narcissism.[Zootrainer|1|0|e8emly5|2018-10-25 06:29:58]

------>One reason is that confidential information is the President's responsibility.   By definition, he is the one  who decides who can see what information and what protections to place on it.  If he leaks confidential information,  it doesn't matter because he has the power to declare any information is not confidential if he wants to.[YRYGAV|1|0|e8ep7hg|2018-10-25 07:18:21]
------>Treason is not when you do something to help a foreign government,  it’s when you help a foreign power during war. People need to stop throwing that word around like it doesnt mean anything. It is 100% awful, awful corruption though, but Americans in government help foreign interests all the time, and they’re not going to receive the death penalty for it.

-------->We're not technically at war with anyone tho. Well NK, but I digress.  U.S. Cons***ution › Article III > Section 3 Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort.  It's debatable and seems to change on a daily basis as to whether Russia and China are enemies. [sirdarksoul|1|0|e8emx0j|2018-10-25 06:35:18]
------>Because Obama set precedent in 2008 by not giving up his personal Blackberry. Once you make an exception for one president, you have to make it for all going forward.

---------->Yes, that one. If the exception hadn't been made we wouldn't be here.   But taking *** for tat just means that the root of the problem never gets solved.

[evergreenyankee|-10|0|e8ed9y9|2018-10-25 04:02:56]
------>How would this possibly be treason? If he called up China and told him all this stuff directly it still wouldn't be treason. Now if he gave them our launch codes and they used them. That would be treason.[yournosyneighbors|-4|0|e8ekl45|2018-10-25 05:56:46]
------>> How is this not treason by negligence.  Because treason has a very well defined and specific legal definition.  You may want to look it up before throwing the word around.

------>And Hillary with an unsecured server? [elosoloco|-2|0|e8elg39|2018-10-25 06:10:31]
------>Hillary was proven to have used insecure channels as well. Lock Trump and Hillary both up.[Cmoz|-8|0|e8ec42a|2018-10-25 03:44:54]
-------->Hillary Clinton also had her Filipino maid print out cl***ified emails.  https://nypost.com/2016/11/06/clinton-directed-her-maid-to-print-out-cl***ified-materials/  Snopes rates the claim as unproven, but its also worth noting that the Clinton camp went silent on the damaging claim and never issued any kind of re***al. Not so much as a simple "no its not true." [BaycoBay|-9|0|e8ed7ul|2018-10-25 04:02:01]

------>Serious question. Isn't this breaking some kind of law? Why are there no repercussions?[etymologynerd|135|0|e8efifj|2018-10-25 04:38:07]
-------->Because the president said it's not illegal while waving his hand in the air. [ben_wuz_hear|136|0|e8eflbb|2018-10-25 04:39:22]
-------->Because he's the president. That's literally it. The president can decl***ify information at his own discretion with no oversight. That's one of the reasons we HAVE a president, so he can choose who gets what information.  If Trump had literally any other job in the world and did that he'd be guilty of a major information breach. In an ideal world we'd have a congress and judicial branch reigning in a president making poor decisions like this, but unfortunately the ruling party is in Trump's pocket and are running interference for him instead.[Wazula42|242|0|e8efvl2|2018-10-25 04:43:43]

---------------->which brings up a great point: voting is great but organizing is even better. volunteering for a campaign or party, joining a labor union, donating money or even running for office yourself are all ways to make a meaningful difference in politics. voter apathy is a huge problem but it's caused by things like lack of information or dissatisfaction with the ballot: things which can only be changed by good organizers.[legendoftheark|1|0|e8emh5p|2018-10-25 06:27:37]

---->> \[He\]... *is not well versed in the operational specifics of military or covert activities.*   I would hope not. As the leader of the military he has no need to be versed in the operational specifics. His job is to set policy and broad strategic objectives for the military. He says "I want you to stop ISIS," then tells his Defense Secretary to collaborate with others in his field, like the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on the overall strategy of the campaign and submit it for his approval.  A perfect example of this going wrong was during Vietnam. There are famous pictures of Nixon and Defense Secretary McNamara selecting individual bombing targets from the White House. That level of micromanagement in an armed conflict is irresponsible and usually ends in defeat.     > *he rarely digs into the details of the intelligence he is shown*   Again, I thank *** he doesn't. He should trust his intelligence agencies, which are generally filled with professionals with years of experience, to provide him with useful intelligence.

-------------->> We the people say *** outrage culture and partisan politics.  The problem is "we the people" don't say "*** outrage culture and partisan politics". Look at the 2016 election.  On one side is a democratic robot who is completely and utterly unrelatable to the average person who championed herself as an establishment candidate in a clearly anti-establishment election cycle. She was so focused on her campaign that as secretary of state she intentionally used an unsecured private server for official white house communications to avoid FOIA requests, resulting in security breaches that very well may have in formed the "bad guys" that the consulate in Benghazi was *entirely incapable* of defending itself in the event it was attacked. Did I forget to mention that the DNC did everything in their power to skew the primary for Hillary including limiting the number of debates that were held, scheduling said debates opposite of major programming like football, skirting campaign finance laws by funning DNC campaign money to Clinton, and actively strategizing with the Clinton campaign to defeat Bernie in the primaries?  The other candidate is literally a reality TV star who came his affluence through defaulting on bank loans from failed real estate ventures and yet continued to be bankrolled by Deutche Bank because it was laundering money for... wait for it... Russia. Did I mention he is on his third wife and has a penchant for banging *** stars? He jokes about ***ually ***aulting women because it is apparently acceptable for a presidential candidate to, "Grab ’em by the ***. You can do anything." This is in addition to being the single biggest flip-flopper in election history and doesn't hesitate from stating blatant lies because he does it so much that the public becomes completely numb to his dishonesty. Did I forget to mention that all of his political opponents in the campaign banded together in an attempt to defeat him, pleading with the american people to vote as a block for one of them because Trump was such a bad human being that they would rather outright lose the individual race than have Trump on the ticket representing the Republican Party?  And yet people still voted for these two pieces of ***t. Seriously, the 2016 election cycle was the biggest farce of an election I've ever seen from both the Democrats and the Republicans. But here we are, with 3rd parties receiving almost no votes when both the democrat and republican candidates were both complete trash. I'm the only person I know who voted 3rd part or wrote someone in. Only a handful actually *liked* either Clinton or Trump, but they voted for them despite knowing they were pieces of ***t.  I *wish* "We the people say *** outrage culture and partisan politics". Sadly, that just isn't true. People want to win and they will vote for the ***t candidate that has either a D or an R in front of their name.  As a side note, I am upvoting you because we need more people who will stand up to this partisan bull***t that is ruining this country.[koshpointoh|1|0|e8eoidx|2018-10-25 07:04:56]

Requiring staffers to log her into her secure terminal because p***words are hard, and purposefully byp***ing protocols, such as walking out of the secure building to use a personal phone to send an email with cl***ified info because it was easier.  This is just as awful, but so far its just been for personal conversations and whatnot. That said, there is a solid argument that anything the president says that isnt to reports should be considered at least confidential and they should avoid using non-secure coms entirely. They have literally an entire arm of the government to ***ist, they dont need to good and twitter themselves.   It is worth noting Obama also resisted trading in his blackberry for a secure device. Though he acquiesced pretty quickly.  He was one of the first presidents that even used a goddam cell phone. In 2008. [gnomeshell|-3|0|e8elyzr|2018-10-25 06:19:10]

Member***p costs were doubled from $100k to $200k last year after Trump was elected, with $14,000 in annual fees.   Mar-a-lago trips alone (amongst many other golf/resort excursions) have cost north of $25 mil in tax dollars.

And even then, a lot of that 'cl***ified' material had a short shelf life since they were about things like meetings or phone calls she was going to have with foreign officials (once the meetings were over, the info was no longer relevant)   What she did was still wrong, but the difference between her and Trump is like the difference (IMHO) between speeding and vehicular homicide.

------>I don't think that's true at all - out of 30,000 emails only 100ish contained anything that was deemed any level of cl***ified - that's 0.3 percent...slightly short of the 100% you posit.    Whereas Trump is well known for speaking before thinking and for sharing cl***ified info (i.e. revealing intelligence sources to Putin) [weluckyfew|1|0|e8eo797|2018-10-25 06:59:04]
-------->in terms of damage dealt, it's not what percentage of emails contain cl***ified information, the damage is potentially done via having 100ish saved there to begin with, whether that's 5% or 95% is irrelevant. it was bad enough that she even deleted the conversations about it, the email scandal was a big deal, just as this is a big deal. both ***ed up m***ively and nothing will happen because of it.

-->Sigh... Forget Trump for a second. It is the hypocrisy of Republican voters and legislators that is horrifying. Day after day after day, for the last two years, some scandal comes up and turn a blind eye to it. They will not care about this either.  He didn't release his tax returns, they didn't care. He didn't put his companies in a blind trust, they didn't care. He appointed his unqualified daughter and son in law to key positions and sent them on key trips, some of which turned out quite shady btw, they didn't care. A *** load of people from his staff was indicted and charged or plead guilty to different crimes, they didn't care. Hundreds of millions of Dollars worth tax evasion scheme was reported just couple of weeks ago (I honestly am not sure how long has p***ed), his "self-made man" image was shattered to pieces, they didn't care. He skyrocketed the deficit as a result of the tax cut that was primarily given to the richest people in the US, they didn't care. His lies are constantly disproven and they don't care.  Honestly, I can go on like this, especially if I take 5 minutes to use Google for other stuff they didn't care about. But this is just it. They do not care. The Republican voters and legislators have already made their minds up and they do not care about anything about the terrible facts that have or might come out. They just hate Democrats, who they can blame for everything wrong with their lives; despite the fact that Republicans are in power and most of the policy changes that hurt middle and lower income areas came from them.  They do not love their country because time and again it has been proven that Trump does not have the best interest of the country in his heart. Just looking at the unqualified appointments he has made or tried to make should be enough to on its own to make people see this. They love their party, they love having scapegoats that they can use to blame for their own failings. They love the fantasy of yesteryear more than the reality of today and accept that the world is changing.[jay_alfred_prufrock|1|0|e8eo72b|2018-10-25 06:58:58]

---------->Republicans make up 56% of the house and 51% of the Senate. They received 42% of the votes in the house and 39% of the votes in the senate. So obviously even if you go out and vote not republican your vote counts about 10% less than a republican vote[NHFI|13|0|e8eky6f|2018-10-25 06:02:34]
---------->It really isn't an exaggeration at all. Even if you vote for one of the two candidates with a chance to win, those two have been preselected by the parties, who are largely ***-in-hand of the big donors. The last few years have shown that the most charismatic candidates have some chance of equalizing things without taking big money donations, but the results haven't been encouraging. Our electoral system is ***ing us hard. We need major systemic change, and it's opposed by those in power, since that system favors them and keeps them in office.

---->That's so sensational. When did we reach this point you think? [IWasBornSoYoung|11|0|e8e7rjt|2018-10-25 02:35:33]
------>The problem with change is that people only notice it when it impacts them. You only notice the construction on your daily commute, not the other roads in the area.  Things like net neutrality, environmental care, taxes, and voting rights follow the same formula. Until it affects your day to day, you will not speak out against it.  The famous poem "First they came..." is exactly this issue. In modern times, busniess and politicians have figure out how to use this against people to earn money and power.  We are not entirely at this point, and some issues are farther along than they seem, and some not so much. The US still has options to turn it around, but soon it may become too late. Half the country is nearly brainwashed, regurgitating everything the extreme left or extreme right feeds the. People can't trust the media because they sensationalize everything for money. They can't trust their leaders because they manipulate and lie for money and power.   Plato said, "The price good men pay for indifference to public affairs is to be ruled by evil men." In other words, we may be good people, but until we start standing up for ourselves and thinking for ourselves, we deserve every single bit of misfortune, political buffoonery, and loss of freedoms we get.  So long story short, it can get to "that point" very very quickly. Go vote, become an advocate, and think for yourself for once. It baffles me how people could complain about long lines voting on a weekday but try and grocery shop on a Sunday.[loaferbro|1|0|e8en2za|2018-10-25 06:38:18]
---->The needed changes can't happen without something breaking the right wing propaganda cult apart. It's firmly in control of over 40% of Americans. They aren't all racists and fascists in love with Trump's real agenda, but they get fed so much fear and hatred from Fox and friends that they go along with it anyway. They aren't living in reality anymore. Their decisions are in the hands of their TV, radio, and social media handlers.[f_d|8|0|e8efq6v|2018-10-25 04:41:26]

-------->It's a huge issue actually. Our jails an prisons are filling up rapidly with low level drug offenders. People who should be given a slap on the wrist or rehab are forced into prisons with felonies that make it *** near impossible to reintegrate into society and become a working citizens.   Privatized prisons are morally repugnant and inhumane.   There have been judges, ******ing judges***, that have been caught getting kick backs from private prisons.   The prison industrial complex is a huge problem in America, and cannabis prohibition is a keystone of it.[Kentsfulcrum|1|0|e8en7hl|2018-10-25 06:40:38]
---------->Those issues aren't automatixally fixed by legalisation. Nor are they exclusively caused by weed being illegal.   There are countries that don't have those issues where getting caught with weed will ruin your life.   There are countries that don't have those issues where weed is sold in cafes. [Adm_Chookington|1|0|e8eoa1a|2018-10-25 07:00:34]
---------->Your not wrong, but the War in Drugs is bigger than weed. I know when I hear people making an issue about legalizing, it's almost always in the context of middle cl*** people wanting to use it recreationally, not as it being a reason to trap someone in prison for slave labor and tax money for private contractors. [stoogemcduck|1|0|e8eqjum|2018-10-25 07:46:24]
---------->> It's a huge issue actually. Our jails an prisons are filling up rapidly with low level drug offenders.   define this outside of the statement.    How rapidly, when did this start?    "There have been judges, ***ing judges, that have been caught getting kick backs from private prisons."  This just magically occurred after the last President transformed America just by being elected? White people are throwing blacks in Jail and Eric Holder was too busy missing Russian election interference to do anything???, what the *** was Eric Holder doing in office outside of sucking?     So was Obama the ***t or just ***t?    Either he fundamentally changed America or he sucked a bag of ***s and the media spent the last eight years  blowing him every time he spoke. Based on that no ***t a barely comprehensible orange man destroyed your Ivy League presidential candidate.   HE CHANGED AMERICA SO MUCH BY BEING ELECTED THE NEXT ELECTED OFFICIAL THREW EVERYTHING OUT THE FUCKING WINDOW.   Give me a ***ing break. The fact you can't beat Orange man is more of an indictment on you than the party that put Orange man up  in the first place.    Either he is incompetent or the next  Adolf.  He can't be both. [b009152|1|0|e8eno12|2018-10-25 06:49:01]
------------>I'm not talking about any president. Only the last part of your comment about cannabis prohibition. So maybe try again? And leave what ever anger you got inside of you on the table before you hit the keyboard.   I think almost every president is a corrupt piece of the machine. That's why I didn't mention Obama or bush or Trump.   The root cause has been and will always be money. Private prisons make a fortune for everyone involved but the prisoners and guards.

-------------->I hate him for his actions. We put a bonafied ***ing moron into the highest seat of power we could ***ing find and the only thing he has done personally is use an unsecured phone to do most of his communications on which the Russians and Chinese actually listen to all of his communications through that phone. Which would be a bigger issue if he ever took the time to read his security briefings. He's uninformed. He's likely guilty of tax fraud. He's likely committed treason. He raped one of his wives, which she listed as a reason for divorce. He cheated on his current wife while she was pregnant, with a ***star. We found the bottom of the *** barrel and decided that that was good enough. We were ***ing wrong. There's no redeeming quality to that sub-human pile of trash. Oh and he spends most of his weekends golfing. At his own ***ing resort/club. Guess who has to go with him? Secret Service. Guess who has to pay for their own rooms at full price? Secret Service. He's actively using his position to enrich himself. [StormTrooperQ|1|0|e8epbf5|2018-10-25 07:20:29]

Agreed that’s horrible and disgusting. However let’s not pretend that’s the worst, or even close to the worst in politics. Ted Kennedy who left a woman to die in a car underwater. Bill Clinton inserting a cigar into Monica Lewinsky.  >Guess who has to go with him? Secret Service. Guess who has to pay for their own rooms at full price? Secret Service.   I have a feeling they don’t have to pay for their own rooms. I believe it would be more of the government giving them a per diem to pay for it.  I disagree with a lot of the things he says and some things he does. However I’m not sure why people seem to think all of this nonsense started with Trump.

He likes to get on the phone at night and have long conversations with people that he knows and trusts (his gossiping with Hannity made the news a while back.) The problem is, none of these people are sworn to secrecy and Trump has zero qualms about discussing cl***ified information or at least information that is better kept out of the public eye (from his perspective.)   So he basically has his bed time dish with whoever he ends up calling, that person then tells other people (because gossip is endemic in Wa***ngton and really any large organization) and eventually it gets out.

Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper appears on NBC’s Meet the Press and says no wiretap activity was mounted against Trump while Clapper oversaw the national security apparatus.   //  At the House Intelligence Committee hearing, Comey and NSA Director Mike Rogers both deny that there was any information supporting Trump’s allegations in his original tweet.  "With respect to the president's tweets about alleged wiretapping directed at him by the prior administration, I have no information that supports those tweets and we have looked carefully inside the FBI," Comey said. "The Department of Justice has asked me to share with you that the answer is the same for the Department of Justice and all its components. The department has no information that supports those tweets."At the House Intelligence Committee hearing, Comey and NSA Director Mike Rogers both deny that there was any information supporting Trump’s allegations in his original tweet.  //  White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders on ABC’s This Week says she thought Trump based his allegations on sources "that have led him to believe there was potential."  "Everybody acts like President Trump is the one that came up with this idea," Huckabee Sanders says. "There are multiple news outlets that have reported this." PolitiFact rated that False, as no credible news reports had said that Obama wiretapped Trump.  This was verified false a year ago. Why do you refuse to acknowledge that trump blatantly lied about himself being secretly wiretapped? It's not even misleading in any form, it's an outright lie that is easily disproven.   ALSO, I'm ***uming you're referring to Paul Manafort being wiretapped and investigated before/during/after the elections? I didn't know Donald Trunp and Paul Manafort were the same person.

-->Just putting Trump's oafishness aside for a moment. The US has been carrying out surveillance like this for more than half a century. More recently, wikileaks exposed that the NSA had full control over a number of world leader's devices including mic and video feeds. And that Obama was aware of the program under Bush and then himself green lit American intelligence hacking and monitoring US allies. And the American intelligence community worked to find/create exploits on iOS and Android devices and ensure they remain unpatched by the manufacturers so that American IC could backdoor almost anyone's device. When they came across devices that they were not able to rewrite firmware on (ZTE and Huawei), they forced them out of the market so that NSA and other agencies can have a higher rate of penetration of US consumers.  And of course the NSA itself was hacked and it's phone hacking packages were stolen and distributed to much of the rest of the world. Which in some ways you could consider ethical karma, a rebalancing of the scales, somewhat obvious that it was going to happen, etc.[goldenbawls|1|0|e8eqcau|2018-10-25 07:41:47]

---->The article's source is from people upset that he isn't taking their advice. The people in question don't actually know what he's talking about, which causes them concern that he could reveal national security secrets. They're also concerned that based on his conversations being intercepted, they'll try and run direct influence campaigns on the president.  It's being compared to Hillary because there's concern that he could be carelessly mishandling sensitive national security information, but at this time, beyond the one incident where he told Russian officials in person that terrorists in Syria were planning to use some kind of portable computer bomb using USBs, there's no evidence of him leaking confidential security information in his phone calls and they are trying to take solace in the fact that Trump is paranoid in general and always believes his calls are being monitored anyway and doesn't pay much attention to his security briefings.  The concern is that he's being too careless about what people around him view as something he should take more precautions with.[Darkframemaster43|10|0|e8elvzz|2018-10-25 06:17:48]

-------->The President, who was fully informed, has been actively ignoring his security advisers' pleadings to stop using his own personal phone. It's not about other countries  spying, it's about the President being a national security risk.

---->You seem to be confused about the issue.  No one is pointing a finger at Russia and China in this case, because as you pointed out, it's normal for one country to do everything they can to spy on other nations.  The issue here is that the president of the united states refuses to use secure communications.  China and Russia should continue trying to spy, as should the US.  The leaders of these countries have an obligation to protect themeselves (and therefore their countries) as much as possible.[Hifen|1|0|e8enp85|2018-10-25 06:49:39]

------>Actually, it wasn't for "personal convenience", it was to get around FOIA requirements.  It's no more or less convenient to have your own mail server sending email to your phone, or mail client.  Literally the only thing that accomplishes is that it gives you the ability to destroy any evidence if it is subpoenaed.  Which, surprise surprise, is exactly what happened.   But that aside, the REAL crux behind the "but her emails!" was that we know she transmitted cl***ified information - in violation of law and protocol - on that private server.  That violated laws against both transmission and storage of cl***ified information.  And that's just the stuff that wasn't deleted.[ScrobDobbins|1|0|e8eog1u|2018-10-25 07:03:47]

-------->Let’s say that this journalist named their source.   Wouldn’t their source get fired?[007meow|1|0|e8eo88c|2018-10-25 06:59:36]
---------->I agree with you in theory, but you would also have to admit that the odds of the journalist getting caught if they totally fabricated the story are slim to none because of how standard it is for a journalist to protect their source even when it turns out their source lied to them.  I've long wondered why that is.  If I were accepting information from someone while keeping them anonymous, I would make it crystal clear that if I found out they were lying for any reason (whether to advance their own agenda, trying to take attention off of another story, or any other number of reasons a source might lie) that I not only wouldn't protect them, but I would out them.  To be clear, that would ONLY apply in a case where the source's claims are proven to be false.  Just a case of "unable to verify" or "the other person denies the claim" wouldn't make me out the source, of course.  I feel like that would go a long way in establi***ng trust in situations like this.  It would also make people think twice before sharing something they know to be false.  I can't be the only one bothered that there have been instances of these "sources familiar with x's thinking" being flat out wrong and they never get mentioned again.  If there isn't going to be any sort of follow up when that happens, there's no way to distinguish between a journalist who made up a source and one who was lied to.[ScrobDobbins|1|0|e8eoy8w|2018-10-25 07:13:24]
------------>Journalistic integrity.   Plus media outlets put their reputation on the line every time they use an unnamed source.   The editor and supporting staff are going to do their *** hardest to vet the information by cross-verifying it and getting it from multiple sources before they put their rep on the line. [007meow|1|0|e8ep1ha|2018-10-25 07:15:09]
-------------->But they don't put their reputation on the line.  Every major outlet has had an article based on an unnamed source turn out to be totally false.  And they are still major trusted outlets using unnamed sources with no mention of being wrong in the past.  In many instances, they don't even do a "mea culpa" and call attention to the fact that they got it wrong.  And those are just the ones where it was possible for the source to be proven wrong.  In these "he said, she said" cases where it can almost never be truly proven one way or the other, they are absolutely risking nothing at all.  And given that even a well-intentioned journalist can be had by a source with an agenda, I really don't see what the downside would be in a system like I mentioned.  Especially since it would go a long way to actually adding some trust - at least in those situations where the truth will eventually come out.[ScrobDobbins|1|0|e8epee7|2018-10-25 07:22:07]

-------->Not if what Trump says on the telephone is turned around to blackmail the man and cause the man to have any less control over the country than he has. Regardless of how much you think you are more important than the country as a whole is, what he says on the phone can, in the wrong hands, have very serious repercussions for everyone, not just me.

-------->Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper appears on NBC’s Meet the Press and says no wiretap activity was mounted against Trump while Clapper oversaw the national security apparatus.   White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders on ABC’s This Week says she thought Trump based his allegations on sources "that have led him to believe there was potential."  "Everybody acts like President Trump is the one that came up with this idea," Huckabee Sanders says. "There are multiple news outlets that have reported this." PolitiFact rated that False, as no credible news reports had said that Obama wiretapped Trump    At the House Intelligence Committee hearing, Comey and NSA Director Mike Rogers both deny that there was any information supporting Trump’s allegations in his original tweet.  "With respect to the president's tweets about alleged wiretapping directed at him by the prior administration, I have no information that supports those tweets and we have looked carefully inside the FBI," Comey said. "The Department of Justice has asked me to share with you that the answer is the same for the Department of Justice and all its components.

Unless the Russians are bugging the rooms he is in with these phones (which is not claimed), then this is meaningless even if it is true.   Trump is from Florida and has dealt with plenty of 80s gangsters who all know not to say anything tangible on the phone. If they were eavesdropped on, this is intentional.  Finally, if Trump is colluding with the Russians, then they don't need to listen in, they already are allies in lockstep.

I mean there’s no consequences if executive branch civil servants allow themselves to be spied on because they chose to use their own communication platforms. Well at least there’s no consequences for them personally.  Of course the nation suffers, our enemies get intelligence that can be use to damage us, we grow weaker an more vulnerable as a nation and a people, but since we decided not to care about it when our Secretary of State did it, how in the name of Zeus’s ***hole are we supposed to care now?[Dutchtrs|-9|0|e8efyy2|2018-10-25 04:45:07]
